presenting first name namepattern last name namepattern first name titles last name titles shortness breath times several weeks worsening over the last days she two pillow orthopnea negative paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea chest pain palpitations she noted increasing lower extremity edema over the last week she cough which productive white sputum night sweats weight loss she denies fever chills nausea vomiting she using inhalers feel that they effective with regard dyspnea she oxygen home the patient previous workup shortness breath included angiogram which was negative pulmonary embolism notable bilateral ground glass opacities transthoracic echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction greater than with mild aortic mitral regurgitation she moderate pericardial effusion noted the transthoracic echocardiogram past medical history pernicious anemia chronic obstructive pulmonary disease depression bilateral total knee replacements pelvic mass found the left

pericardial effusion change echocardiogram transthoracic echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction greater than with loculated moderate sized pericardial effusion with fibrin deposits the surface the heart echocardiographic signs tamponade compared with prior echocardiogram the pericardial effusion appears loculated this point electrocardiogram admission showed normal sinus rhythm waves iii avf which were old wave abnormalities through which were nonspecific hospital course the patient age over year old female with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease breast cancer anemia who presents with acute worsening chronic shortness breath cardiovascular the patient was initially thought congestive heart failure was aggressive diuresed until creatinine bumped she was ruled out myocardial infarction negative cardiac enzymes numerous occasions hospitalization serial echocardiograms were performed times four which showed moderate sized pericardial effusion without signs tamponade evidence diastolic dysfunction the patient dyspnea improve there was concern that the effusion was compromising cardiac output ability mobilize fluid therefore pericardial window was placed with greater than bloody fluid out the drain was left until there was improvement the patient dyspnea the window was placed the pericardial drainage tube was pulled the pericardial fluid was bloody there was concern malignant effusion however cytology revealed malignant cells was significant reactive mesothelial cells red blood cells lymphocytes neutrophils the patient also occasional episodes ectopy atrial fibrillation supraventricular tachycardia which was thought related the pericardial window drain with resulting irritation she was started metoprolol twice day rhythm abnormalities improvement congestive heart failure pulmonary the patient main complaint admission was acute worsening chronic dyspnea over the last month upon medical record review appears that the patient complaints dyspnea since previous admission the beginning november she was noted oxygen saturation room air the cardiologic etiologies the dyspnea was extensively investigated she improvement with diuresis pericardial window multiple rule outs myocardial infarction was felt that there was pulmonary etiology the likely explanation dyspnea given the patient history chronic metastatic breast cancer lymphatic spread the cancer was thought the source dyspnea thoracentesis was performed yellow straw colored fluid was removed the fluid was later found positive malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma the patient was ruled pulmonary embolism just prior admission although she was oxygen home she consistent three four liter nasal cannula oxygen requirement throughout the hospitalization the patient was transferred the medical intensive care unit following pericardial window placement consideration swan ganz catheter was undertaken however the patient family opted pursue less aggressive treatment course the swan ganz was placed volume status instead was estimated per clinical examination radiograph evidence that was available renal admission the patient creatinine was bumped high with diuresis with fluid hydration the pericardial window was placed the creatinine trended currently the time discharge infectious disease the patient was treated with ten day course antibiotics presumed pneumonia which improve pulmonary status hematology the patient baseline pernicious anemia received injection admission she continue these injections monthly gastrointestinal the patient chronically constipated worsening constipation throughout hospitalization abdomen became progressively distended tender the end hospital course while she was the micu liver function tests were performed found normal several occasions abdominal ray showed distended large bowel however she was eventually able move bowels two three days prior discharge abdominal exam number significantly improve the bowel movements given elevated lactate there was concern bowel wall ischemia ileus obstruction previous known large pelvic mass the option abdomen was discussed with the patient family who agreed perform the study given the risks worsening renal function contrast load their wish pursue surgical intervention the etiology abdominal pain was likely functional constipation she was continued aggressive bowel regimen with per rectum medication enemas needed fluids electrolytes nutrition throughout hospitalization the patient minimal appetite secondary cancer anorexia episodes nausea emesis emesis was thought secondary functional constipation she was able tolerate fluids pureed food occasion was able take oral medications family meeting nasogastric tube was discussed with the possibility starting tube feeds the family however think this was consistent with the patient wishes therefore nasogastric tube was placed likewise the option percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was also felt the family consistent with the patient wishes oncology admission the patient known diagnosis metastatic breast cancer which was recently diagnosed outpatient oncologist first name stitle feel chemotherapy was indicated the time diagnosis she was instead started femara given that the tumor was estrogen receptor positive code status family meeting was held long discussion the progression the patient disease lack response medical management was decided the patient family that she would resuscitate intubate pursue aggressive medical treatment this point medications were simplified she was prepared transition skilled nursing facility with the possibility hospice care the near future this time she was comfort measures however future medical decision making would contingent upon optimizing the quality life condition discharge stable discharge diagnoses metastatic breast cancer bone retroperitoneal lymph number omentum pelvic mass thought secondary
