admission date discharge date date birth sex service medicine hospital firm history present illness per admitting intensive care unit intern known patient lastname year old woman with metastatic breast cancer subcutaneous tissue lung liver bone brain who presented hospital hospital endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography bile leak status post cholecystectomy perforated gallbladder the evening the patient developed the acute onset epigastric pain presented hospital hospital where she was found acute abdomen she was tachycardic white blood cell count reportedly the patient was taken the operating room exploratory laparotomy she underwent cholecystectomy intraoperatively the patient was found free bilious fluid the abdomen well adhesions omentum the posterior surface the gallbladder through which the bile was leaking there was obvious gallbladder metastases however there was large palpable mass the retroperitoneum felt either pancreatic mass versus retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy that time the decision was made pursue internal stenting via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography later date thus biopsy liver metastases was obtained there were intraoperative cholangiogram there was obvious indication biliary obstruction though right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed dilatation the common bile duct well dilatation the intrahepatic bile ducts postoperatively the patient complained shortness breath chest ray revealed total opacification left lung was felt represent infiltrates plus effusion the patient oxygen saturation dropped less than the patient was given intravenous lasix the patient left sided pleural effusion was drained thoracentesis the fluid which was found exudative postoperatively the patient was put levofloxacin metronidazole she was still levofloxacin transfer hospital where she was meant undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography review systems review systems the patient denied history lower extremity edema chest pain shortness breath nausea vomiting diarrhea fever chills past medical history metastatic breast cancer diagnosed approximately two years ago metastatic the liver bone lung brain small bowel areas status post two cycles navelbine status post two cycles taxol carboplatin last cycle ended status post radiation therapy brain metastases echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction wall motion abnormalities were found normal right ventricular function was noted there was some mild pulmonary hypertension medications admission outpatient medications included percocet decadron ativan zofran duragesic patch medications transfer medications transfer hospital hospital included ascorbic acid intramuscularly pepcid intravenously duragesic patch mcg neupogen mcg heparin

reportedly revealed gram stain negative white blood cell count with polys lymphocytes red blood cells were total protein albumin ldh glucose radiology imaging chest ray the outside hospital reportedly revealed almost complete opacity the left hemithorax with some right opacification ultrasound performed the outside hospital reportedly revealed massive dilatation the common bile duct with dilatation the intrahepatic bile duct the pancreatic head structures were well visualized hospital course the patient was admitted transfer hospital hospital the hospital intensive care unit the patient intensive care unit course was notable decreased urine output which responded intravenous boluses also the patient was mildly tachycardic with oxygen saturations room air these difficulties resolved over later that day the patient was called out the medicine floor where she was transferred the hospital medicine firm the patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography this revealed massive common bile duct dilatation with distal common bile duct obstruction previous cholecystectomy with leak through the cystic stump was noted that time the patient underwent successful sphincterotomy with successful metal covered wallstent placed the common bile duct also noted the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was antral gastritis the patient was maintained intravenous antibiotics approximately hours post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography thereafter she was switched levofloxacin metronidazole the patient diet was successfully advanced she was tolerating food well approximately hours post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography terms the patient pulmonary status the patient left pleural effusion was noted recurred due exudative nature the patient diagnosis was felt that the patient pleural effusions would continue recurrent despite efforts repeated thoracenteses thus the pleural disease service was consulted they discussed various options with the patient including the possibility pleurodesis however that time the patient wished defer that option she was breathing well without difficulty the patient was given contact
