gastrointestinal bleed mitral valve prolapse status post coronary artery bypass graft times two mitral valve repair episodic atrial fibrillation left ventricular outflow obstruction history present illness the patient year old woman who was admitted the hospital with complaints shortness breath she denied chest pains palpitations that time she was hypotensive chest ray was consistent with congestive heart failure computerized tomography scan was obtained rule out pulmonary embolism given the history breast cancer the patient history allergy shellfish computerized tomography scan was ultimately negative pulmonary thrombosis the patient became acutely short breath bronchospastic she was presumed allergic reaction the intravenous contrast dye was treated with epinephrine solu medrol well benadryl despite this the patient became hypoxic was intubated transferred the intensive care unit dopamine drip was started swan ganz monitoring was used dobutamine was started presumed cardiogenic shock although there was specific etiology heparin drip was also begun the patient ptt went the patient subsequently developed bloody emesis via nasogastric tube hematocrit dropped she was transfused units packed red blood cells repeat hematocrit was heparin was discontinued the patient was also started broad spectrum antibiotics levaquin vancomycin flagyl the patient was then transferred the hospital catheterization past medical history bronchitis asthma status post right lumpectomy breast cancer fibromyalgia hypertension increased cholesterol mitral valve prolapse palpitations allergies penicillin shellfish demerol percocet medications medications home were atenolol lipitor amitriptyline physical examination intubated alert moves extremities follows commands vital signs temperature heartrate blood pressure respirations oxygenation cardiovascular tachycardiac systolic ejection murmur the apex chest significant rales the right mid lung field abdomen soft nontender nondistended obese extremities warm noncyanotic nonedematous times four neurological was grossly intact the patient right internal jugular swan ganz catheter left radial arterial line intubated with nasogastric tube foley catheter two peripheral intravenous lines laboratory data complete blood count with neutrophils chemistry arterial blood gases fio creatinine kinase troponin chest ray reveals mild congestive heart failure with question right middle lobe infiltrate there was some small left pleural effusion electrocardiogram sinus rhythm depression with wave flattening the lateral leads hospital course the patient was admitted with the presumptive diagnosis cardiogenic shock possibly transient ischemia she also upper gastrointestinal bleed leukocytosis with lowgrade temperatures also indicated the possibility lung infection gastrointestinal standpoint the patient esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed which revealed blood the fundus multiple small lesions actively bleeding was felt that those lesions probably represented arteriovenous malformations gastroenterology recommendations were avoid non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs transfuse prn avoid nasogastric tube suction the patient also begin proton pump inhibitors protonix the patient was extubated hospital day without difficulty saturations remained face mask the patient was premedicated cardiac catheterization given possible allergic reaction intravenous dye cardiac catheterization revealed mitral regurgitation with ejection fraction there was some anterior hypokinesis the coronary system was right dominant there was noted occlusion obtuse marginal the mid right coronary artery intra aortic balloon pump was placed that time cardiology also recommended coronary artery bypass graft mitral valve repair the patient also episode supraventricular tachycardia with rate then converted back sinus rhythm with total intravenous lopressor cardiac surgery consultation was obtained hospital day which agreed with operative repair the patient then underwent coronary artery bypass graft times two with saphenous vein graft the descending right coronary artery saphenous vein graft the obtuse marginal well mitral valve repair with doctor last name doctor last name annuloplasty band postoperatively the patient was taken the intensive care unit closer monitoring the patient was subsequently extubated that evening postoperatively the patient well the intensive care unit intra aortic balloon pump was discontinued postoperative day she was also transfused unit packed red blood cells the patient was transferred the floor postoperative day seemed well chest tubes wires were discontinued the evening postoperative day the patient went rapid atrial fibrillation was given intravenous lopressor well amiodarone the patient rate remained uncontrolled blood pressure began drop the patient was transferred back the intensive care unit closer monitoring the patient received additional amiodarone intravenous bolus well amiodarone drip the patient subsequently converted back normal sinus rhythm postoperative day the patient was transferred back the floor she continued work with physical therapy well with this postoperative day the patient went second episode rapid atrial fibrillation approximately the patient remained asymptomatic throughout without chest pain shortness breath she complain subjective palpitations heartrate was with blood pressure maintained the saturations were room air the patient converted back normal sinus rhythm with intravenous lopressor magnesium sulfate given lowest blood pressure drop was subsequent this electrophysiology was consulted they recommended outpatient doctor last name hearts monitoring well amiodarone taper regimen they also recommended obtaining echocardiogram prior discharge assess the left ventricular function well mitral valve function echocardiogram was obtained which revealed still some mild moderate mitral regurgitation well significant left ventricular outflow obstruction due the mitral leaflets left ventricular function remained greater than the effect was hyperdynamic the patient was kept house closer monitoring well increasing beta blockade the goal was decrease the patient heartrate the hopefully the the patient tolerated this disease the patient was discharged home postoperative day tolerating regular diet given adequate pain control pain medications anticoagulation was begun due history gastrointestinal bleeds probable arteriovenous malformations discharge medications colace
