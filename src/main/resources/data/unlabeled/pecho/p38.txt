metastatic disease brief summary hospital course year old female with metastatic breast cancer lungs liver bone apparently xeloda herceptin admitted superior vena cava syndrome secondary thrombus superior vena cava clot the patient was noted clot superior vena cava likely related port cath which was involved with the clot according radiology secondary report the patient was immediately placed heparin drip consideration thrombectomy versus interventional radiology procedures was considered given the patient significant symptoms dyspnea well facial swelling she was started tpa infusion total hours the tpa infusion was per interventional radiology protocol the patient was monitored the intensive care unit this infusion period the patient was monitored signs bleeding the infusion the patient heparin drip was decreased she was closely monitored neurologic bleeding signs bleeding the tpa was infused through port cath the infusion was per hour times eight hours then per hour times hours patient inr fibrinogen platelets hematocrits were followed this infusion fibrinogen was less than tpa dose would decreased half was less than tpa number discontinued completely the patient fibrinogen remained stable throughout tpa was tolerated well the repeat cta showed complete clearance clot along wall the superior vena cava very small filling defect there was fibrin sheath residual clot was unclear along the terminal portion the port cath just tip given the small filling defect likely fibrin sheath the port cath intervention was considered with interventional radiology well surgery the consideration included balloon angioplasty catheter stripping through interventional radiology versus surgical advancement the catheter tip improved placement there was thought that the current catheter placement was likely causing some vessel wall injury which led the clot formation final decision was made the patient fully anticoagulated coumadin goal inr approximately one month full anticoagulation last name stitle who the surgical consult agreed advance the catheter the right atrium avoid vessel injury likely clot formation total six months anticoagulation was recommended last name stitle the interventional radiologists addition last name stitle recommended avoid sclerosing agents used the port cath which may cause additional vessel wall injury possible clot formation
