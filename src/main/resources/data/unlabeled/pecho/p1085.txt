admission date discharge date date birth sex service medicine this continuation previous discharge summary hospital course pulmonary prospective the patient went suction thrombectomy interventional radiology ivc filter was placed that time well left pulmonary artery stent was also placed the patient went well under general anesthesia minimal clot was aspirated back leading the placement the stent question whether the embolus was tumor origin the chest abdomen pelvis subsequently showed that there was tumor show multiple right greater than left acute subacute pulmonary emboli there were emboli the right pulmonary artery leading the right upper lobe pulmonary artery the left mean pulmonary artery leading the left lower lobe pulmonary artery the patient became increasing hypoxic was electively intubated the patient underwent bronchoscopy which was unrevealing bal cultures subsequently grow out anything also the chest ray revealed left lower lobe infiltrate the the patient became increasing hypoxic required which was slowly weaned fio over the next days the patient underwent trial nitric oxide without change cardiac output urine output pulmonary vascular resistance thus the nitric oxide was discontinued these numbers were obtained with swan place the patient awoke sedation the last eight days this was prompted flumazenil injection with good response the patient worsening left lower lobe infiltrate required increasing amounts oxygen stabilized fio with peep the patient received bedside tracheostomy cardiovascular the patient received three echocardiograms showed approximately the same thing ejection fraction greater than with hyperdynamic that showed abnormal septal motion consistent with volume pressure overload last name sign admission pointing acute pulmonary process electrocardiogram admission the patient lead the which cleared the suction thrombectomy stent placement subsequently the pattern returned with presumed repeated either breakup the initial with breaking through the ivc filter when the patient was intubated the patient became hypotensive required levophed low doses maintain blood pressure this was due the time the sedation medicine given induction the intubation the the patient became acutely hypotensive required three pressors levophed neo synephrine vasopressin the patient was maxed out three pressors those fluids blood pressure rose approximately this day that the pattern returned the patient was weaned the neo synephrine the patient was given stress dose steroids persistent hypotension swan ganz catheter was placed measure pressures the pulmonary vasculature the objective was maximize cardiac output urine output the swan numbers were consistent with right heart failure with ventricular interdependence overnight the remaining pressors were weaned the levophed the vasopressin were stopped through the the cardiac output slowly increased day the swan was discontinued the urine output also rose this time the patient drop blood pressure crackles pulmonary exam swan was placed that time that showed non cardiogenic pulmonary edema levophed therapy was initiated hypotension the the swan was discontinued the pressors were discontinued cardiac output continued rise the through the the patient cardiovascularly stable hematologic point view the patient was started heparin upon admission pulmonary embolus admission the patient was transfused units keep hematocrit greater than also admission the patient platelets were within the normal limits over the subsequent number days the patient platelets dropped nadir work was initiated prior this hit antibodies came back positive igm that time heparin was discontinued hematologic consult was obtained refludan was started platelets stabilized eventually increased over subsequent days note the hematologic work hypercoagulability was limited the patient was heparin antithrombin therapy stay this point however anticardiolipin antibody was igm positive the patient received multiple transfusions with transfusion criteria ranging depending the past volume status infectious disease point view the chest ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate that time ceftriaxone zithromax were started cultures were sent the patient positive urine culture citrobacter pansensitive therapy was adjusted however the the patient became hypotensive noted previously the antibiotics were broadened ceftriaxone zithromax vancomycin ceftazidime that time the patient stabilized the treatment course persisted ten days with vancomycin ceftazidime these were discontinued diflucan was started presumed urinary tract infection the patient was febrile overnight was pancultured the cultures revealed yeast the sputum urine the patient was febrile overnight was pancultured vancomycin therapy was initiated staph aureus grew out the sputum that was previously sent that time ceftazidime was initiated the patient continued febrile blood cultures throughout this time were negative infectious disease consult was obtained also the the sensitivities returned the staph aureus the sputum methicillin resistant staph aureus the infectious disease team recommended the discontinuation the ceftazidime the discontinuation the diflucan they presumed that the yeast was colonizer source infection these antibiotics were discontinued the also the the patient spike another fever note throughout this time numerous line changes were made with the tips sent culture nothing every grew out them also note upwards blood cultures including isolator bottles were sent cultures were ever positive since the the patient remained afebrile monotherapy vancomycin the presumed methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia oncologic prospective the patient xrt was held upon admission can resumed when the patient returned outpatient life renal the patient decreased urine output starting the day she became hypotensive required three pressors maintain blood pressure urine electrolytes were consistent with prerenal examining the urine revealed casts thus the belief the team was that low urine output was prerenal weaned the pressors maintaining stable blood pressure own urine output increased was quite good over subsequent days lasix therapy was initiated with good effect agitation agitation defined increased respiratory rate tachycardia likely secondary dyspnea the patient maintained good urine output since continues receive lasix needed gastrointestinal admission intubation the patient decreased bowel sounds would tolerate tube feeds the source this was unclear the time however was believed that the morphine used sedate may playing role discontinuation the morphine the patient return bowel sounds began tolerating tube feeds tolerated tube feeds since without problems fluid status the patient low albumin which come since admission remains low this lead intervascular volume depletion extravascular volume increase long term the patient will require diuresis she restores body supply albumin endocrine random cortisol level was appropriate response the current stress steroids were given persistent hypotension were discontinued two days later the patient diabetic regular insulin sliding scale throughout admission with fingersticks intermittently the patient required insulin drip persistent hyperglycemia also the patient hypothyroid standing outpatient synthroid dose since admission neurologically admission the stoke team interventional radiology were consulted the aneurysm left basilar tip numbers quoted were risk rupture per month interventional radiology stated they would coil this was found stable outpatient within one two weeks this currently hold until the patient overall health status improves planned some point the future the time this was considered direct contraindication thrombolytic therapy which why interventional radiology performed the suction thrombectomy also neurologic prospective the patient woke number days sedation was awake following commands she seems very sensitive sedation this interim dictation known patient firstname known patient lastname
