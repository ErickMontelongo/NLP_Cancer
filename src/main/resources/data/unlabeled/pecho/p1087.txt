throughout the procedure the patient was placed under general anesthesia the right groin was prepared sterile fashion local anesthesia with lidocaine the right femoral vein was ended with one stick gauge needle over initials namepattern last name namepattern guidewire french dilator was advanced exchange was made amplatz guidewire with curved tip french stationary sheath was advanced the inferior vena cava hand injection distal inferior vena cava demonstrated there was large clot obstructing the passage the right heart note also was that there was extremely slow flow the inferior vena

pulmonary artery arteriogram was performed this arteriogram over date pulmonary angio clip clip number radiology reason contrast optiray amt final report cont demonstrated the same fashion reflux the right pulmonary arteriogram apple core shaped filling defect the main left pulmonary arteries permitting minimal flow beyond this site the descending pulmonary artery basically fill with the exception some small branches slow those was static venous washout the left lung observed there were some smaller clots distal the site obstruction pressure the left main pulmonary artery measured mmhg mean mmhg the decision was made proceed with suction thrombectomy the left lung wire was advanced through the location catheter advanced segmental branch arising the descending left pulmonary artery removal the catheter suction thrombectomy assembly was advanced the assembly consisted long envou french guiding catheter coaxially loaded french suction catheter coaxially loaded french peel away sheath advanced through the french stationary sheath initialy aspiration was performed through the guiding catheter however very small amount peripheral clots were removed then the french suction catheter was pressed the filling defect negative suction was achieved the assembly was removed there was however removal clot movement whatsoever this maneuver was repeated twice time placement the location catheter repeat suction this point was clear that the filling defect the left lung was clot conjunction with apple core appearance possibly represents tumor the decision was therefore made proceed with opening the outflow tract this purpose the location catheter was advanced the left pulmonary artery amplatz guidewire was advanced the descending pulmonary artery exchange was made angioplasty balloon with this balloon the left main pulmonary artery the transitioning descending pulmonary artery was subjected angioplasty subsequently the balloon catheter was advanced the descending pulmonary artery since there was some smaller clots seen previously likely stasis distal the central obstruction this point pressure was taken assure that dilatations would lead reperfusion edema the lung however pressure this site measured mean mercury therefore there was concern that would dealing with chronically hypotensive region distal the site proximal obstruction also assure that smaller clot that formed wou dissolve the patient infusion tpa the left descending pulmonary artery while withdrawing the catheter distally proximally tpa was given the patient also known intracranial aneurysm the hand the small amount was felt represent systemic risk was hoped contribute opening the peripheral microcirculation arteriogram was performed exchange with location catheter demonstrated that there was flow within the left descending pulmonary artery allso filling the left upper lobe pulmonary arery there was still the apple core shaped filling defect however central channel created

exchange was made long doctor last name stent was successfully deployed the descending pulmonary artery prevent loss the just placed stent centrally provide anchoring the main pulmonary artery another stent with dimensions diameter lengths was placed the end the stent placement final arteriogram was performed demonstrated now reasonably good flow the left pulmonary artery with washout the venous phase the pressure this point the pulmonary arteries measured with mean mmhg the catheter was then removed the stationary sheath was then the low inferior venacava cavogram was performed the cavogram was used localize the level the renal veins the right vein inferior orifice was chosen site placement the tip initials namepattern last name namepattern filter over guidewire the delivery capsule the location filter was advanced the filter was deployed the desired location the sheath was removed hemostasis was achieved the procedure the patient was relatively labile blood pressure particularly the angioplasty manipulations the left left pulmonary circulation the oxygen dropped saturation despite ventilation under general anesthesia the end the procedure the patient blood pressure systolic therefore levodrip was stopped she however also heart rate around this point which increased transient when the patient was transported back the hospital teh elevated blood pressure continued decrease
