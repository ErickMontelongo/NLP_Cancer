family prior procedure the patient was intubated ventilated was transferred bed the angiography table supine position the entire procedure was performed under general anesthesia administered monitored the anesthesiology team the patient right neck right flank were sterilly draped prepped under ultrasound guidance gauge needle was advanced through abdominal wall the right flank last name wire was advanced the right paracolic gutter the needle was exchanged french omniflush catheter which was positioned under ultrasound then under fluoroscopic guidance the perihepatic space the catheter was connected vacuum drainage this yielded normal looking yellowish nonturbid ascitic fluid three liters ascites evacuated replacement with two units albumin was started the anesthesiologist additional liter ascites was then evacuated total volume ascites drained liters over date tips clip clip number radiology reason tips admitting diagnosis gastrointestinal bleed contrast optiray amt final report cont while the ascites drainage was progress access was obtained the right internal jugular vein under real time ultrasound guidance with gauge needle local anesthesia with lidocaine guidewire was easily advanced through the needle the vein the needle was exchanged french micropuncture sheath the tip which was positioned over the wire the superior vena cava the wire inner dilator were exchanged standard guidewire the micropuncture sheath was exchanged dilator eventually long cook sheath was placed over the wire with tip the level the right atrium inferior vena cava ivc junction the right hepatic vein was selectively catheterized using glidewire cobra glidecatheter the catheter was then exchanged over the wire doctor last name catheter the tip which was positioned the right hepatic vein the wire was removed the balloon the doctor last name catheter was inflated with the balloon the doctor last name catheter inflated posterior anterior lateral wedged hepatic venograms were obtained with carbon dioxide contrast doctor last name these venograms showed patency the right hepatic vein reflux gaseous contrast the portal system with landmarks obtained the balloon the doctor last name catheter was then deflated transcatheter pressure measurements free wedge positions showed mean pressure gradient the doctor last name catheter was then exchanged over doctor last name wire the cobra glidecatheter the doctor last name wire was exchanged tipped amplatz superstiff wire which was coiled the right hepatic vein metallic last name needle was advanced over the wire under fluoroscopic guidance through the sheath the level the right hepatic vein the wire was then removed multiple attempts under fluoroscopic guidance the frontal lateral projections access was obtained the portal system confirmed contrast injection through the needle under fluoroscopy glidewire was advanced through the needle the right portal vein then followed the cobra glidecatheter advanced through the needle removal the wire contrast injection through this catheter showed small extravasation the catheter was then pulled back over the wire the wire was redirected the right portal system until tip reached the left portal veins the catheter was then advanced over the wire portal venogram was obtained this showed patency the main portal trunk right left branches their intrahepatic ramifications the glidewire the cobra glidecatheter were then manipulated towards the main portal vein trunk advanced the level the superior mesenteric vein smv contrast injection under fluoroscopy confirmed appropriate position the catheter tip the glide wire was exchanged the amplatz superstiff tipped wire which was placed under fluoroscopy over date tips clip clip number radiology reason tips admitting diagnosis gastrointestinal bleed contrast optiray amt final report cont the smv the last name needle was removed well the cobra glidecatheter diameter length balloon catheter was then advanced over the wire repeated balloon inflation was performed along the intrahepatic tract under fluoroscopy providing landmarks future stent placement the balloon catheter was then placed the main portal trunk deflated removal the wire portal venogram was obtained showing opacification the portal vein intrahepatic branches this also showed contrast passing through small irregular intrahepatic shunt some opacification the splenic vein the left gastric vein small gastric vein these two veins were small caliber connected multiple varicosities joining eventually the area the lower esophagus initials namepattern last name namepattern wire was advanced through the balloon catheter placed the smv tip the sheath was advanced over the balloon catheter the main portal vein trunk the balloon catheter was removed over the wire exchanged the delivery system wallstent pulling back the sheath the central portion the right hepatic vein the wallstent was deployed successfully under fluoroscopy then stent opening was obtained serial balloon angioplasty diameter with the tip the balloon catheter the smv another venogram was obtained showing opacification the smv main portal vein preferential opacification intrahepatic shunt the stent was properly positioned with cranial end the right hepatic vein caudal end the cranial portion the main portal vein the very central portion the right portal vein was opacified over length opacification the left portal system was observed minimal opacification the central portion the gastric vein was noted opacification the varices was longer present transcatheter pressure measurements were obtained showed resolution the prior pressure gradient with residual gradient mmhg mean pressure the catheter sheath were removed over wire exchanged quadruple lumen short central venous catheter which was left place with tip the level the right atrium this catheter was sutured the skin using silk sterile dressing was placed the patient was transferred back bed removal the ascites drainage catheter compressive dressing was applied over the right internal jugular venous access site due persisting oozing the patient was then transferred the medical icu
