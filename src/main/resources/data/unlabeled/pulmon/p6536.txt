last name hospital evaluation management left frontal mass was admitted the sicu neurology neuro onocology were consulted the patients right sided weakness expressive aphasia which persisted hospitalization were attributed the left frontal mass the patient underwent staging scans given that the mass was possibly metastatic the scans were remarkable spiculated mass the right lower lobe the lung there were also some thyroid nodules noted the patient underwent sterotatic brain biopsy with local anethesia with pathology consistent revealed metastic carcinoma though the final pathologic stains yet completed the general consensus that the carcinoma lung origin given the patient overall condition with severe copd pneumonia probable aspiration pneumonitis was considered surgical candidate this was discussed multidisciplinary meeting involving medicine neurosurgery neuro oncology whole brain radiation was instead recommended the patient began this treatment following consultation radiation oncology the patient tolerated the first two sessions whole brain irradiation well scheduled receive total radiation treatments hospital hospital medical center medical oncology was consulted evaluation probable lung cancer they recommended follow with pulmonary oncologist the patient radiation treatment complete the final path results complete note the patient poor pulmonary status was thought relate lung mass given small the lung mass the patient clearly severe underlying emphysema well probable recurrent aspiration the patient was treated supportively the brain mass with high dose steroids dexamethasone phenytoin tid with dose adjusted per level goal level will need stay these least until radiation complete beyond that point subarachnoid hemorrhage following brain biopsy the patient routine post surgical head which showed small subarachnoid hemorrhage the left parietal region the patient change neurological exam associated with this follow head was stable progression hemmorhage copd the patient exacerbation emphysema when was transferred hospital was treated with steroids which were dosed brain mass nebulizers levofloxacin possible rml pneumonia resolution the exacerbation the patient continued receive regular nebulizer treatments was requiring liters oxygen nasal cannula the time discharge oxygen saturations would occasionaly drop the mid high note the patient was asymptomatic these episodes saturations improved with nebulizer treatment supplemental oxygen community acquired pneumonia upon admission the patient found right middle lobe pneumonia which recieved day course levofloxacin the patient pulmonary status improve with treatment however stay was noted difficultly clearing secretions ronchorus breath sounds sputum cultures were persistently negative contaminated aspiration pneumonitis the patient exam diffuse ronchi poor cough chest rays were suggestive aspiration the underwent video swallow study which was negative aspiration despite this was put aspiration precautions chest was recommended least daily help the patient clear secretions mucinex mucormyst were also given given somewhat tenuous state the patient was given empiric antibiotic therapy levo flagyl possible aspiration pneumonia day treatment the day discharge uti the patient was treated enterococcal urinary tract infection with day course ampicillin htn was hypertensive admission remained beta blocker throughout stay cad the patient underwent cardiac preoperative risk stratification persantine mibi which showed lvef now definite
