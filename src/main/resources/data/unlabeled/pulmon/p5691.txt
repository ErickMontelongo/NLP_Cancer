biopsy the time vertebroplasty was unrevealing lll mass likely primary lung cancer however definitive tissue pathology was obtained despite several attempts including transbronchial biopsy ddx included thyroid renal cell cancers the patient large thyroid nodule which was unable biopsied secondary neck fracture constraints oncology consulted who thought patient was chemotherapy candidate
