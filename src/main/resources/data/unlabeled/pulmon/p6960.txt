however over the next several days was determined that the evd was infected with coagulase negative staphylococcus which was treated with intravenous intraventricular vancomycin until cultures csf were negative seven consecutive days the evd was then removed ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed without complication the patient mental status continued improve the time discharge decadron weaned
