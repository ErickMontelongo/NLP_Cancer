oropharyngeal swallow reason eval swallow prophiciency underlying medical condition year old man with left vocal cord paralysis per ent thoracic surgery meds lobectomy reason this examination eval swallow prophiciency indications year old man with left vocal cord paralysis following thoracic surgery technique videotaped oropharyngeal swallowing study findings the study was performed conjunction with the speech swallow pathologist various consistencies barium were administered under videofluoroscopy due poor bolus control premature spillover was observed the piriform sinuses with thin liquids laryngeal valve closure was mildly impaired the left vocal cord showed paralysis residue the piriform sinuses valleculae cleared with multiple swallows pharyngeal contraction was symmetric mild penetration with sips thin liquids was observed with spillover throat clearing was effective moderate amount silent aspiration was observed with multiple sips thin liquids related spillover cough was effective clearance also there was reduced sensation with lack spontaneous cough this aspiration occurred with larger boluses with smaller boluses thin liquids via straw trace penetration was observed impression moderate aspiration with larger boluses thin liquids with penetration the vestibules seen smaller boluses paralysis left vocal cord summary presents with mild oropharyngeal dysphagia demonstrated aspiration penetration with thin liquids the examination however small bolus sizes were effective preventing aspiration when was focused the swallowing task also demonstrated deep penetration with small straw sips thin liquids consideration left vocal cord paresis very likely that this the cause poor valve closure thus compromising airway protection with larger boluses therefore based this examination recommended that continue with regular diet with thin liquids while taking small sips thin liquids straws demonstrated good understanding the instructions given the evaluation will follow with the ensure that these instructions followed meals recommendations recommend that continue regular diet with thin liquids meds should take small sips thin liquids should use
