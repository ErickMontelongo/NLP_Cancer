intermittently hypotensive also bradycardic times per family request pressor were given became clear given the patients invasive lung cancer severe coronary artery disease that the prognosis was extremely poor family meeting was held the outcome this was that would remain intubated would also still dnr would given escalation care including pressors antiarrhythmics the family asked whether would possible send home ventilator that may spend last days home such arrangements were made required that the patient undergo tracheostomy unfortunately the patient was never sufficiently hemodynamically stable that this procedure safely performed another family meeting was held was explained that tracheostomy was possible perform safely that the patient would probably spend the remainder days the hospital the daughters decided that care should move toward comfort measures efforts were made pursue care such that the patient would remain alive over the weekend that may
