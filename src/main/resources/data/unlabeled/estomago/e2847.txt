admission date discharge date date birth sex service cardiothoracic surgery history the present illness the patient year old asian male who history hypertension was yard work syncopal event was admitted hospital ekg which was suspicious was started lopressor transferred hospital cardiac catheterization underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed ejection fraction with anterior basal hypokinesis anterolateral hypokinesis apical dyskinesis inferior posterior basal hypokinesis left main coronary artery showed stenosis left anterior descending artery ostial proximal severe diffuse disease was totally occluded the first diagonal left circumflex showed major with ostial lesion distal stenosis right coronary artery dominant with mid tubular stenosis distal stenosis also echocardiogram which revealed moderate severe mitral regurgitation was then referred cardiac surgery past medical history history hypertension history pneumonia social history lives home with wife smoke drink alcohol allergies the patient known drug allergies admission medications taken medications home transfer was taking lopressor aspirin review systems unremarkable physical examination admission general the patient was well developed well nourished asian male apparent distress the vital signs were stable heent perrl eomi oropharynx benign with good dentition neck was supple with full range motion lymphadenopathy thyromegaly carotids were equal bilaterally without bruits lungs were clear auscultation bilaterally heart revealed regular rate rhythm without rub gallop there iii holosystolic ejection murmur the apex the axilla abdomen positive bowel sounds soft nontender without masses hepatosplenomegaly extremities without clubbing cyanosis edema pulses bilaterally throughout neurologic nonfocal laboratory radiologic data admission white count hematocrit platelet count potassium bun creatinine the ekg showed sinus rhythm the with elevations the inferior leads elevations hospital course while awaiting surgery was seen the electrophysiology staff regards syncopal episode they feel that syncopal episode was consistent with possible vagal episode they felt that they would rather studies following cabg that point may may place aicd underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three with left internal mammary artery left anterior descending artery saphenous vein graft the saphenous vein graft the pda also mitral valve replacement with carbomedics mechanical valve intra aortic balloon pump placed intraoperatively this surgery was performed first name namepattern last name namepattern with first name namepattern last name namepattern nurse practitioner the assistant the surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with the cardiopulmonary bypass time minutes cross clamp time minutes the patient was transferred the cardiac surgery recovery unit epinephrine milrinone nitroglycerin propofol normal sinus rhythm two atrial two ventricular pacing wires two mediastinal one left pleural chest tube the immediate postoperative period the patient was noted nosebleed increased chest tube drainage was given protamine unit ffp units packed cells one dose cryoprecipitate was noted profound hypotension underwent tee which revealed hypokinetic anterior wall was actually better than the immediate postoperative tee postoperative day number one remained sedated intubated continued the milrinone drip the epinephrine drip was weaned micrograms epinephrine drip was eventually weaned discontinued that day postoperative day number two milrinone was decreased was started lasix diuresis also postoperative day number two sedation was lightened was able move everything commands became hypotensive was eventually placed back the propofol drip postoperative day number three was continued hemodynamically stable epinephrine with the milrinone weaned slightly intra aortic balloon pump was discontinued without incident continued sedated the ventilator was weaned also this day was noted atrial flutter amiodarone bolus was given was almost cardioverted converted normal sinus rhythm own also propofol was weaned this day the propofol was very slow wake remained lethargic the following postoperative day follow commands move extremities postoperative day number four the ventilator continued very slowly weaned milrinone was decreased later that day paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which converted normal sinus rhythm then junctional rhythm continued amiodarone started heparin postoperative day number five chest tube discontinued new left subclavian cordis swan placed chest ray show left sided pneumothorax new chest tube inserted that side which showed reinflation the left lung postoperative day number six milrinone was discontinued continued good cardiac function was also extubated postoperative day number six tolerated that well postoperative day number seven was started heparin anticoagulation atrial fibrillation mechanical mitral valve was also transferred the surgical floor this day began aggressive physical therapy postoperative day number eight was decided that coumadin should held case the plan study insertion icd would done this admission continued treated with heparin coumadin held while the electrophysiology service sorted out echocardiogram decided when would the best time studies rise white blood cell count postoperative day number nine cultures were sent chest ray show left lower lobe consolidation was started levofloxacin postoperative day number was complaining throat pain was noted purulent exudate around uvula was started rocephin that levaquin was discontinued coumadin continued held inr bumped high were waiting decreased remove pacing wires that time was felt that would need studies this admission the plan was return discharge see last name stitle electrophysiology workup postoperative day number inr drifted pacing wires were discontinued without incident was restarted coumadin was awaiting elevation inr discharged home over the next week receive doses anywhere coumadin time inr would bump the range the remainder hospital course was uncomplicated the second attempt anticoagulation inr drifted was started coumadin was discharged this dose discharge examination vital signs heart rate blood pressure respirations saturation room air lungs clear auscultation bilaterally heart regular rate rhythm abdomen positive bowel sounds soft nontender nondistended extremities without edema neurologic alert oriented times two moving extremities incisions were clean dry intact sternum was stable discharge laboratory data white count hematocrit platelet count sodium potassium chloride bun creatinine blood glucose with inr discharge chest ray showed lungs clear with very small left apical pneumothorax discharge medications enteric coated aspirin captopril amiodarone atenolol coumadin the night discharge then needed maintain inr condition
