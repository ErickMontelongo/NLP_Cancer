pleural effusions urinary tract infection parkinson diabetes mellitus type osteoarthritis glaucoma status post hysterectomy status post goiter removal status post spinal surgery bone spur admission history physical the patient year old female who presented initially surgical evaluation workup postprandial abdominal pain which found gastric mass gastrointestinal series subsequently revealed large gastric mass with increased soft tissue density within the transverse colon the patient subsequently esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed submucosal infiltrative circumferential mass malignant appearance the antrum stomach body pathology which showed adenocarcinoma the signet ring cell type with chronic inactive gastritis the patient therefore was evaluated subtotal versus total gastrectomy initial presentation weight was pounds she was otherwise afebrile heent was unremarkable the neck was supple without mass nodules thyromegaly the chest was clear auscultation percussion the heart sounds were regular there was notably grade systolic ejection murmur heard best the left sternal border that radiates the carotids with minor radiation the axilla the abdomen was soft with upper abdominal mass which was consistent with the distal stomach which felt firm there well healed lower midline scar there were masses there was ascites the extremities showed clubbing cyanosis edema there was mild moderate tremor noted present preoperative laboratories preoperative hematocrit was preoperative platelet count was hospital course the patient was admitted that same day underwent total gastrectomy with placement feeding jejunostomy without note intraoperative complications intraoperatively was noted that there was large tumor the stomach which was lienitis plastica type which involved mostly the distal stomach notably the lesser curvature the stomach was also involved without lymphatic type invasion which made subtotal gastrectomy impossible the celiac access was noted quite firm there were obvious liver mets the patient tolerated the procedure well was extubated the operating room taken the post anesthesia care unit stable condition notably the patient jehovah witness she refused sort transfusion blood products therefore there was concern sort bleeding that the patient might encounter postoperatively hematocrit was which the patient was tolerating well with satisfactory saturation evidence tachycardia hypoxia the initial postoperative phase she was mildly volume depleted which she was hydrated resulting good urine output blood draws were minimized the postoperative period order avoid over phlebotomizing the patient neurologically pain was initially controlled with epidural which was subsequently discontinued she was switched over intravenous pain medications followed pain medications without sort difficulty she notably experience some mental status changes which seemed resolve treatment urinary tract infection she postoperatively also reduction the patient narcotics respiratory the patient persistent requirement several days surgery the chest ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions was deemed that thoracentesis would indicated case therefore she was diuresed somewhat with the subsequent improvement respiratory function the time discharge she moderate bilateral pleural effusions was satting the mid room air cardiac the patient develop some postoperative atrial fibrillation with rates high the she was ruled myocardial infarction with the serial cardiac enzymes postoperative atrial fibrillation initially respond intravenous lopressor require cardizem drips which the patient was placed the intensive care unit these episodes resolved two three days prior discharge which time the patient remained sinus rhythm was placed cardizem amiodarone she also require amiodarone the intensive care unit gastrointestinal the patient actually well upper gastrointestinal study postoperative day six evidenced leak stricture nutrition the patient was goal tube feeds promod strength hour the last several days prior discharge addition this she was given post gastrectomy diet which she was tolerating without nausea vomiting she received vitamin shot was receiving supplemental iron renal function bun creatinine were fairly stable were the time the patient discharge she was making good urine she was diuresed needed with lasix secondary volume shifts the postoperative fluid that she received order avoid sort volume overload hematology order stimulate the patient erythropoietin she was started epogen units three times per week this was discontinued prior discharge infectious disease the patient postoperative complication was urinary tract infection which was treated with levofloxacin discontinuation the foley postoperative day nine the patient afebrile remained sinus rhythm several days otherwise with good blood pressures making excellent urine tolerating post gastrectomy diet without difficulty therefore was determined that she would appropriate discharge rehabilitation facility physical therapy seen the patient cleared this when the patient was discharged she was continue tube feeds promote with fiber strength hour meet caloric needs this would addition the post gastrectomy diet which she take otherwise the patient will need monthly vitamin shots also supplementation iron discharge medications iron sulfate liquid sinemet take one tab take one tablet lescol avandamet one tablet amiodarone lopressor diltiazem discharge status the patient was discharged rehab good condition first
