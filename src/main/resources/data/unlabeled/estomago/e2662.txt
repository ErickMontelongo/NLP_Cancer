admission date discharge date date birth sex service general surgery history present illness known patient lastname year old white male with long history acid reflux disease recently was treated with antacid therapy baking soda refractory acid reflux symptoms underwent upper endoscopy which basically revealed friable nonobstructing lower esophageal adenocarcinoma the adenocarcinoma involved one third the esophageal circumference the biopsies taken the time confirmed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with papillary features widespread necrosis addition gastritis the antrum was noted the gastroesophageal junction was involved based pathology the duodenum was normal the ultrasound guided staging was performed well the ultrasound guided examination the mid esophageal mass demonstrated invasion the muscularis propria evidence invasion beyond this consistent with tumor careful examination the remainder the barrett esophagus demonstrated mild wall thickening limited the submucosa with focal masses noted addition there was round isoechoic periesophageal lymph node noted lymphadenopathy was noted scan the abdomen chest was performed which revealed two hyperdense lesions the liver mediastinal hilar lymphadenopathy the bilateral pleural effusions noted were thought related congestive heart failure left lobe atelectasis there was radiologic evidence metastatic disease subsequently mri the liver was performed which was negative evidence metastatic disease the liver the patient was consequently seen last name stitle surgical intervention was recommended past medical history chronic myeloid leukemia first diagnosed adenocarcinoma the esophagus barrett esophagus congestive heart failure myocardial infarctions noninsulin dependent diabetes medications

nontender nondistended masses palpable organomegaly normal bowel sounds rectal examination deferred extremities warm well perfused signs edema imaging studies upper endoscopy performed showed friable nonobstructing lower esophageal adenocarcinoma involving one third the esophageal circumference scan the abdomen performed preoperatively showed two hyperdense lesions the liver mediastinal hilar adenopathy addition bilateral pleural effusions were seen which were thought due congestive heart failure the mri the liver performed preoperatively was negative evidence metastatic disease the liver hospital course given the diagnosis moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma the esophagus surgery was recommended the risks the benefits the procedure were discussed with the patient the patient underwent ivor doctor last name esophagogastrectomy with feeding jejunostomy left tube thoracotomy the patient tolerated the procedure well the estimated blood loss was there were complications please see the full operative note details the patient remained intubated was transferred the intensive care unit stable condition urine output was noted low swan ganz catheter was place remained ventilator support the patient was transfused with packed red blood cells received multiple boluses postoperatively maintain urine output pain was controlled with the epidural catheter the antibiotic coverage included flagyl kefzol originally addition the patient received several packs platelets the tube feeds were initiated blood pressure heart rate were controlled with beta blocker the patient remained sinus rhythm the heart rate blood pressure remained stable the chest tube remained place the nasogastric tube remained suction chest ray was taken showing slight interval increase the left lower lobe consolidation collapse the patient was transfused with packed red blood cells the ventilator support was slowly weaned arterial gas was stable the hematology oncology service was consulted given the history chronic myelogenous leukemia decreasing white blood cell count the recommendation was restart gleevec order avoid cml relapse the patient was followed the hematology oncology service hospitalization the patient was extubated postoperative day three urine output increased remained stable the patient was gently diuresed barium swallow study was performed which showed evidence contrast extravasation the esophagogastric anastomosis the fluids were decreased the patient was transferred the floor postoperative day six stable condition chest physical therapy was initiated the patient was encouraged get out bed postoperative day six the patient complained severe chest pain shortness breath nausea vomiting radiation the pain diaphoresis the time vital signs were stable except respiratory rate was liters decreased breath sounds electrocardiogram obtained the time showed change the baseline diet was slowly advanced full liquids addition the tube feeds nutrition followed the patient throughout hospitalization the patient was noted right arm swelling right upper extremity venous ultrasound was obtained which showed evidence deep venous thrombosis the antibiotics were discontinued the time postoperative day ten the patient complained difficulty breathing however appear acute respiratory distress given tachycardia desaturation echocardiogram was obtained rule out pericardial effusion the findings were symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy regional systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease picc line was placed the patient complained shortness breath coarse sounds lung examination chest ray the time showed right basilar atelectasis consolidation the echocardiogram mentioned previously showed ejection fraction the serum troponin levels were their peak thus the patient ruled myocardial infarction enzymes given increased wheezing shortness breath the patient was transferred the intensive care unit the chest tubes were removed days prior this transfer the patient was diuresed with lasix the intensive care unit was rate controlled with beta blocker cardiology was consulted the time chest ray obtained showed probable congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions increased size since the previous study given the fever large right pleural effusion was successfully aspirated the radiologist the patient creatinine was also noted increasing peaking with bun the renal service was consulted the etiology worsening renal function was thought due decreased left ventricular ejection fraction the patient bun creatinine subsequently improved the patient was consequently reintubated worsening respiratory distress aggressive pulmonary toilet was continued continued tube feeds continued the antibiotic prophylaxis the sputum culture grew enterobacter coli beta streptococcus the coli enterobacter were pansensitive urine culture grew klebsiella which was pansensitive the pleural fluid obtained thoracentesis grew staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive which was sensitive clindamycin gentamicin rifampin vancomycin resistant oxacillin methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus the consequent pleural taps grew bacteria blood cultures remained negative the patient consequently failed another extubation attempt was aggressively diuresed continued receive serial chest rays the patient continued maintain good urine output the patient was closely followed the cardiology heart failure consult was continued lasix diuresis enalapril was added addition was maintained aspirin lopressor failing one extubation attempt the patient was continued diuresed was weaned the ventilator support was finally extubated which tolerated well nasogastric tube was eventually removed continued congestive heart failure with moderately sized effusions which were tapped several times was started vancomycin given methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus which was dosed according serum levels daily weights were closely monitored the patient was eventually transferred the regular floor stable condition physical therapy occupational therapy followed the patient closely remained supplemental oxygen with good oxygenation levels complained another episode shortness breath while the regular floor creatine kinase troponins were negative signs myocardial infarction electrocardiogram was unchanged baseline was tolerating tube feeds well was started clears diet was advanced gastrectomy type diet which also tolerated well remained afebrile hematocrit white count remained stable renal function returned baseline levels continued upper extremity edema which decreased somewhat hospitalization congestive heart failure was managed the cardiology service medications were adjusted regularly the patient was consequently discharged rehabilitation facility condition discharge good discharge destination rehabilitation facility discharge diagnosis
