written informed consent the patient wife the patient was positioned supine the angiography table preprocedure timeout was performed confirm patient procedure site standard sterile prep drape the right inguinal region using palpatory fluoroscopic guidance single wall puncture the right common femoral artery was performed with gauge needle inch guidewire was passed through the needle the abdominal aorta using fluoroscopic guidance the needle was exchanged french vascular sheath which was attached continuous heparinized saline flush berenstein catheter was used select the right subclavian artery right subclavian arteriography demonstrated patency the subclavian right internal mammary thyrocervical trunk lateral thoracic artery costocervical trunk the catheter tip was beyond

selected arteriography performed this demonstrated patency this vessel with supply hypervascular area the right upper lobe the lung with early venous filling the right upper pulmonary vein consistent with arteriovenous shunting based the patient history the diagnostic arteriogram was determined that the patient would good candidate may benefit embolization french microcatheter was placed through the berenstein catheter used select two branches the lateral thoracic artery these branches segment the lateral thoracic artery were embolized with multiple microcoils right lateral thoracic arteriography performed post embolization demonstrated cessation flow the right upper lobe the lung the non embolized branches this artery remained patent several arteriograms the branch vessels the right lateral thoracic artery were performed the course the embolization confirm which branches the vessel required embolization test the success embolization two branches the lateral thoracic artery were selected the microcatheter was removed the berenstein catheter was retracted the right subclavian artery right subclavian arteriography was performed this demonstrated patency the right

arteriography was performed this demonstrated patency the right internal mammary artery major branches proximal branch the right internal mammary artery supplies the right upper lobe the lung abnormal hypervascular area with arteriovenous shunting the right upper pulmonary vein this proximal branch the right internal mammary artery was selected with the tracker microcatheter this was embolized with multiple microcoils arteriography this vessel was performed demonstrating cessation flow the embolized areas with some flow through the proximal coils over date embo clip clip number radiology reason eval left bronchial artery embolization admitting diagnosis hemoptysis lung contrast optiray amt final report cont such coil embolization was undertaken addition embolization with total absolute alcohol given two divided doses the microcatheter was then removed right internal mammary arteriography was performed through the berenstein catheter this demonstrated complete cessation flow through the proximal branch that previously supplying the right upper lobe the lung remainder the right internal mammary artery major branches remain patent however now least two branches the right internal mammary artery demonstrate arterial supply abnormal hypervascular areas the right upper lobe the lung these were demonstrated the earlier pre embolization right internal mammary arteriogram this suggests that embolization one arterial branch leads recruitment arterial branches the right upper lobe this stage the berenstein catheter was retracted the right subclavian artery right subclavian

costocervical trunk non embolized portions the right lateral thoracic artery flow seen through the embolized arteries arterial blood supply the right upper lobe the lung seen branches the right internal mammary artery definite arterial supply the right upper lobe the lung demonstrated the right subclavian artery branches the berenstein catheter was then exchanged over the guidewire pigtail catheter which was positioned the proximal descending thoracic aorta descending thoracic aortography was performed this demonstrated that the arterial supply the right upper lobe the lung the aorta that previously embolized remained patent proximally hypervascular lung was demonstrated this would consistent with the parenchymal level particle embolization that was previously performed the case was then discussed with last name stitle pneumology based these discussions the findings the arteriogram particular the finding that embolization one arterial supply the right upper lobe leads the development visualization new arterial supplies the right upper lobe was determined that embolization may use wires catheters the sheath were removed hemostasis was ensured with direct manual compression there were immediate complications medications total lidocaine subcutaneously was used local anesthetic the right inguinal region total optiray intra arterial radiographic contrast was utilized over date embo clip clip number radiology reason eval left bronchial artery embolization admitting diagnosis hemoptysis lung contrast optiray amt final report cont total coils were used embolization six coils two coils six coils six coils four coils impression multiple collateral arteries were found supplying the right upper lobe the lung the right subclavian artery branches right lateral thoracic artery right internal mammary artery the right lateral thoracic artery two branches one branch the right internal mammary artery were embolized with microcoils residual vessels supplying the right upper lobe tumor still present these became apparent embolization the vessels such there evidence that embolization some feeding vessels leads recruitment feeding vessels was determined that embolization may use note that arteriovenous shunting within the right upper lobe the lung was present the right upper pulmonary vein
