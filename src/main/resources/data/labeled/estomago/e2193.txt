gallbladder the gallbladder markedly distended contains sludge significant wall thickening note the patient locally tender very limited mri was performed this study although trace amount pericholecystic fluid seen the gallbladder was distended that occasion while appearances may represent third spacing with secondary gallbladder wall thickening acalculous cholecystitis excluded correlation with clinical symptoms plus minus hida scan recommended liver gallbladder ultrasound the liver parenchyma appears unremarkable there evidence enlargement the ivc the intrahepatic hepatic

course the hospital hospital course was follows cad the patient was admitted the cmi service elective catheterization abnormal stress test the catheterization was uncomplicated the lcx were found critical lesions were stented with good flow post stent the patient received last name first name plavix cath developed hematemesis melenotic stools first name was stopped the patient was continued plavix asa just stented lipitor beta blocker was held two days transfer out the ccu the patient was started lopressor was premature atrial contractions the remainder course the patient was maintained aspirin statin plavix beta blocker chf the patient received significant amount blood transfusions throughout hospital course was positive fluid balance majority this hospital course the patient complained sob was maintained due rising creatinine initially received one time doses lasix was assessed optimize cardiac function reducing afterload number hydralazine were later added the regimen was later placed home dose lasix the patient was later weaned the oxygen dependent edema later improved rhythm the patient history paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was observed sinus with lbbb ekg throughout hospital course the patient coumadin was held the ccu throughout the rest course becuse gastrointestinal bleed anemia post cath the patient developed hemetemesis melena was found large hct drop was transferred the cmed service was transfused with units prbc one unit ffp hct show appropriate response the patient was transferred the ccu with presumed upper bleed vitals remained stable the patient appeared clinically stable was started ppi drip hct was monitored was seen the service upper scope the scope showed esophogeal ulcer with associated friable mucosa with exudate surrounding erythema stomach cardia showed mass blood clot that time decided that given the patient clinical status friability the lesions they would biopsy the lesion the patient was clinically stable received another units prbc the ccu with suboptimal hct response received another unit prbc hct bumped over remained stable the patient was transferred the cmed service with the plan cont with blood needed monitor hct this point the patient one melenotic stool over hours repeat hemetemesis transferred the floors the patient received prbcs total six admission hematocrit hovered the low melena tapered ugib bleed the patient was seen egd the unit the egd showed small mass malignancy ulcerating lesion epi cauterization were used however biopsy was taken this time the patient repeat egd was clinically stable per reccs the patient was kept ppi coumadin was held diet was advanced hct was kept coagulopathy shock liver preparation the repeat endoscopy the patient coags were monitored despite coumadin heparin receiving vitamin multiple times patient inr remained elevated transaminases were found elevated ast alt acetaminophen was held level was checked was negative patient coagulopathy was attributed shock liver shock liver was attributed hepatic congestion secondary congestive heart failure there was enlargement the ivc intrahepatic hepatic veins consistent with congestion the train thought this point was that right sided heart failure contributed the congestive changes seen the liver hida scan was done which showed delay kinetics suggestive cholecystitis with continued management the patient congestive heart failure transaminases improved coagulopathy resolved there was also concern that the patient use acetaminophen extra strength several months prior admission use acetaminophen hospital course control pain may also contributed shock liver the primary etiology was thought congestive heart failure acute chronic renal insufficiency due patient elevating creatinine renal was consulted they attributed acute renal insufficiency prerenal physiology due low lasix per their reccs number hydralazine were added reduced afterload improve forward flow the setting renal insufficiency phosphate was also elevated renagel was therefore also given the time discharge the patient creatine was near baseline adenocarcinoma biopsy the stomach ulcer was consistent with adenocarcinoma the patient was seen heme onc followup management was scheduled outpatient hypernatremia while the ccu the patient developed mild hypernatremia which was encouraged take medications
