neurologic status was alert oriented person place time range motion strength the upper lower extremities were normal skin showed pathology hospital course known patient lastname was admitted the operating room where underwent ivor doctor last name esophagectomy please refer the dictated operative note full details this procedure the patient was transferred postoperatively the surgical intensive care unit intubated levophed support blood pressure preoperatively placed epidural pain control which the time contained narcotic medications was transfused units packed red blood cells intraoperatively proceeded receive multiple fluid boluses postoperatively decreases urine output postoperative day one continued labile blood pressures the requirement pressors namely levophed help maintain this postoperative day two was found some degree pulmonary deterioration pco continued rise however urine output improve this time known patient lastname also episodes atrial fibrillation postoperative day three the levophed drip was turned the patient blood pressure stabilized with the discontinuation the levophed the patient oxygenation also improved postoperative day four the patient continued intubated sedated showing improvement cardiac index well improvement urine output continued with dilaudid epidural this time tube feeds were started postoperative day five jejunostomy tube with the patient receiving impact with fiber per hour later postoperative day five the patient was found worsening which lasix was given the patient blood pressure remained stable with diuresis the patient oxygenation improved postoperative day six the patient continued require diuresis would occasionally oxygen desaturations turning tube feeds were raised per hour this day also this time the patient was found pneumonia chest ray sputum culture was positive klebsiella which was pan sensitive remained intubated stable over the next number days known patient lastname continued intubated sedated with active diuresis was started levofloxacin pneumonia require occasional suctioning desaturations respiratory status continued fluctuate the patient was concurrently followed consultation the cardiology service due atrial fibrillation previously existing aortic stenosis the patient remained intubated sedated postoperative day this time was continuing tube feeds well levaquin pneumonia this time was following commands due the prolonged course intubation postoperative day tracheostomy was performed the patient tolerated the procedure well was started coumadin postoperative day due prolonged atrial fibrillation this time tube feeds were running goal nutritional rate over the ensuing days the patient began slowly follow commands given the surgical team physical therapy respiratory status remained stable via tracheostomy tube the patient was continued levaquin postoperative day known patient lastname last name titles bedside swallowing evaluation

mobility gain independence with activities daily living postoperative day respectively hemodynamic status were stable improved enough transfer the regular patient floor the patient was tolerating tube feeds without nausea vomiting return bowel function was indicated bowel movements this time the patient continued receive daily doses coumadin with intravenous heparin anticoagulation due atrial fibrillation postoperative day the patient was deemed stable ready transfer acute care rehabilitation facility where continue receive tracheostomy care well tube feeds the patient will require remaining nothing mouth this time will require daily inr checks receiving daily coumadin until inr reached therapeutic level per prolonged continued atrial fibrillation this time the heparin drip may discontinued discharge disposition the patient was acute care rehabilitation facility discharge diet the patient nothing mouth this time receiving impact with fiber full strength per hour discharge activity the patient activity restricted require extensive help with physical therapy occupational therapy regain strength mobility well independence with activities daily living medications discharge
