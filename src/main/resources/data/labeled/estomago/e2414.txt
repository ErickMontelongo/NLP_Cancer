esophagectomy via thoracoscopy laparoscopy assistant first name name pattern last name namepattern anesthesia general indications this gentleman esophageal cancer undergone neoadjuvant treatment previously undergone laparoscopy laparoscopic jejunostomy presents now definitive surgical therapy preparation the operating room the patient underwent general endotracheal anesthetic via double lumen tube intravenous antibiotics were given appropriate lines were placed foley catheter was placed the bladder was placed the left lateral decubitus position with the right side the chest was prepared with betadine solution draped the usual fashion trocar placement number ports were placed anterior the scapula staggered position two trocars were placed well posteriorly findings there was inflammatory change consistent with radiotherapy the thoracic portion there was evidence metastatic disease were there particularly concerning enlarged lymph number the same was true the abdominal portion the tumor appeared become extremely fibrotic there was evidence mucosal tumor when the specimen was removed although there was great deal thickening the esophagogastric junction which either complete response scarring submucosal tumor procedure detail with line ventilation were able reflect the lung over anteriorly began the anterior portion the esophagus taking the inferior pulmonary ligament the level the inferior pulmonary vein dissection was then carried out continuing superiorly were able identify clear the lymphatic tissue over toward the esophagus then cleared the azygos vein were able see the spur the carina come dissect the esophagus surrounding lymphatic tissue the left main stem bronchus clearing the subcarinal packet were unable divide the azygos vein with the endo female first name stapler nice envelope was created the pleura the level the azygos vein then started dissection right the esophageal muscular wall avoid the recurrent laryngeal nerve work way the thoracic inlet completely dissecting this area free penrose drain was placed around the esophagus placed the thoracic inlet easy identification the neck incision then worked inferiorly this area were able encircle the esophagus with penrose drain facilitate dissection were able take the posterior pleura relatively close the azygos vein purposely left the tissue right around the thoracic duct then were able dissect right onto the aorta were able work this level the diaphragm the crura were identified the tissue around was reflected away kept with the esophagus were able complete dissection clearing this area completely seeing the azygos vein the inferior pulmonary vein the left well the left pleura the penrose drain was then left the thorax very close the diaphragm order facilitate dissection the hiatus hemostasis was assured chest tube was placed the lung was reinflated the trocars were removed the larger thoracic incision was closed with interrupted sutures vicryl the musculature the skin was closed with running subcuticular sutures monocryl steri strips dressings were applied the chest tube was hooked wall suction then turned attention the laparoscopic portion the patient was placed supine position the jejunostomy tube was temporarily removed order maintain sterility while the abdomen was prepared the standard sterile fashion the patient was placed lithotomy position trocar placement open technique was used access the peritoneal cavity control the incision used thelaparoscopic jejunostomy which was approximately the xiphoid the abdomen was insufflated trocar was placed laterally the left dilating ports were placed superiorly the left the midclavicular line the right laterally the right later the case trocar was placed the midclavicular line the right this point encountered metastatic disease pathologically enlarged lymph number began dissecting the omentum along the greater curvature the stomach making sure that preserved very nicely the gastroepiploic arcade dissection was carried out with the harmonic scissors then moved upwards toward the short gastrics the patient was fairly large incision was little bit the low side were going forced use longer scope the upper dissection therefore went far with regular scope then started that area the greater curve worked towards the patient right were able get the posterior plane behind the stomach lift the stomach come around find the gastroepiploic origin which was preserved then took the intervening tissuebetween the duodenum the colon the duodenum was then identified was completely kocherized allow maximum mobility the gastrohepatic omentum was then opened the level the diaphragm with harmonic scissors the right gastroepiploic artery was spared using longer scope then completed dissection along the greater curvature treating the short gastric vessels with the harmonic scissors completely freeing the fundus the left crus the esophagus was then identified along with penrose drain facilitate identification the dissection the left gastric artery working were then able identify the tissue around the left gastric artery this was dissected some degree was very close thethe pancreas tissue was then taken with the endo female first name stapler with vascular load some intervening tissue this the esophagus was then taken with the harmonic scissors this point were satisfied with the entire stomach mobilized with the exception the uppermost portion around the hiatus which saved until last prevent pressurized air entering the thoracic cavity then divided some the lesser curvature mesentery using the female first name stapler approximately the pylorus then divided the stomach made long gastric tube based the right gastroepiploic artery using the endo female first name stapler with thick load true diameter was approximately then moved with serial firings were able effect nice long gastric conduit the new gastric conduit was then sutured the specimen using sutures silk order facilitate transfer through the mediastinum then opened the neck using collar incision the sternomastoid was retracted laterally the omohyoid was divided were then able get the direct plane the thoracic inlet were able identify the penrose drain interest that originally small amount difficulty the penrose drain was actually lot higher than thought would entire dissection completed through the thorax the penrose drain was pulled were very satisfied that the esophagus nicely dissected that were high enough almost the level the cricoid with last name stitle the neck position laparoscopy were able then pull the specimen the gastric conduit through the mediastinum the neck avoiding twisting this under laparoscopic guidance very nice amount stomach which was quite healthy should mention that just prior this complete hiatus dissection completely freeing the fundus esophagus the hiatus pulling the penrose drain the mediastinum the penrose drains were then removed prior pulling the stomach through the thorax then fashioned anastomosis using side side technique making holes the esophagus stomach graft well where the end was two runs the endo female first name stapler were then fired the nasogastric tube was then switched the stomach extra amounts esophagus stomach were then divided with another application the female first name stapler the patient was then laparoscoped the stomach was attached the crura using interrupted sutures silk the area was checked hemostasis which was adequate ports were then removed under direct vision without bleeding closure the camera port was closed with interrupted sutures vicryl the fascia the neck was closed with vicryl placed the deeper layers staples the skin the abdominal skin was also closed with staples then attempted replace the jejunostomy which out several hours found difficult slide easily which was extremely surprising try gentle attempts with slightly smaller tube which way away was totally satisfied left this tube place the plan tube study potentially tube replacement under fluoroscopic guidance with contrast following the surgical procedure appropriate dressings were applied the patient was then extubated sent the surgical intensive care unit satisfactory condition tolerating the procedure well drains one chest tube the chest location location drain the neck complications
