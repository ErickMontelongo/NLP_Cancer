patient lastname year old nursing home patient with past medical history significant stroke hypertension chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who came percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement the patient was intubated the procedure the procedure the patient was extubated was maintaining good oxygen saturation liters oxygen through the nasal cannula sudden the patient became apneic chest ray was obtained which showed right upper lung collapse which appeared secondary some bronchial mucous plugging that time was decided reintubate the patient the patient was reintubated bronchoscopy was done significant amount secretion bronchial mucous plugging was removed repeat chest ray was done which showed reinflation the right upper lobe the bronchoscopy that time the patient was the post anesthesia care unit addition the patient also became very hypotensive was started lopressor neo mcg min blood pressure improved systolic the patient also history methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus colonization the past the surgery team who the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement contacted the medicine intensive care unit asked the patient transferred the

was awake responded some verbal commands head eyes ears nose throat pupils equal round reactive light accommodation jugulovenous distension flat lymphadenopathy noted lungs mild wheezing the bilateral lower lobes heart regular rate rhythm murmurs rubs gallops heard abdomen soft nondistended nontender hepatosplenomegaly noted positive percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube the left side extremities edema cyanosis clubbing distal pulses laboratory data admission white count was hematocrit platelets sodium potassium chloride bicarbonate bun creatinine glucose calcium phosphorus magnesium ptt inr electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm sinus tachycardiac elevation noted normal intervals chest ray evidence pneumothorax resolution right upper lung collapse compared the previous ray that was done prior the reintubation hospital course pulmonary the patient was initially intubated the procedure the procedure the patient was extubated became apneic oxygen saturation dropped chest ray showed right upper lobe collapse the patient was reintubated bronchoscopy was done with significant amount mucous clubbing secretions were removed repeat chest ray the bronchoscopy showed reinflation the right upper lobe attempt was made extubate the patient the patient failed secondary increase secretions that time was also thought volume overload the patient was receiving significant amount fluid boluses the patient was hypotension were trying wean the pressor she was getting fluid the failure extubation was decided extensively diurese the patient treat the patient secretions initially the patient was assist control then she would switched over pressor support pressor support positive end expiratory pressure fio the patient would tolerate that well however whenever attempt was made wean mechanical ventilation lowering the pressor support the patient would become tachypneic tachycardiac the title volumes would decrease the patient would tolerate that very well despite multiple attempts wean mechanical ventilation extensive discussion was held with the family which was decided that would try extubate one time she would fail extubation what would the next thing that time two sons doctor last name first name namepattern known patient lastname reached agreement ahead extubate the patient the patient would fail extubation would make comfortable they would want ahead with trach that point around the patient was extubated extubation the patient was well oxygen saturations were liters through the nasal cannula cardiovascular rate rhythm the patient was mostly normal sinus rhythm would get occasional premature atrial contractions premature ventricular contractions electrolytes would need rechecked repeated needed ischemia ischemic changes signs noted electrocardiogram pump the patient was initially pressor neo mcg min however that was weaned within day two the patient transferred the medicine intensive care unit the patient also received multiple fluid boluses help maintain blood pressure infectious disease the patient known baseline white blood cell count the range initially admission the medicine intensive care unit white count was that time decided start broad coverage levofloxacin flagyl questionable aspiration pneumonia since she the bronchial plugging that lead the right upper lung collapse however that was discontinued one day two when the white count came significantly that time was thought that the reason why she elevated white count was probably secondary the stressfulness the procedure addition the patient was also started vancomycin initially hours known methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus colonization vancomycin trough level was obtained which was slightly elevated based the pharmacy recommendations vancomycin was changed hours addition the patient was also started cefepime intravenously pseudomonas coverage since sputum grew out mild moderate pseudomonas aeruginosa which was sensitive cefepime mild moderate methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus gastrointestinal the patient questionable status post gastric cancer needs verification the patient percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed dressings were changed per protocol the patient receiving tube feeds through that without difficulty heme hematocrit fallen was initially thought that this drastic fall secondary overhydration since the patient was becoming hypotensive iron studies were obtained which were found unremarkable since then hematocrit the range anywhere the patient was transfused units blood fluids electrolytes nutrition mentioned earlier the patient received multiple boluses since she was initially hypotensive baseline blood pressure found anywhere systolics the patient was also given lasix help with the diuresis since thought she was volume overloaded addition the patient also getting tube feeds through the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube she was electrolytes checked usually repeated needed
