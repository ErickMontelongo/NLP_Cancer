prbcs low hct persistent hypotension later that day patient went with fast ventricular response the first time ultimately responsing amiodorone bolus ongoing drip she returned nsr shortly thereafter pod patient progressive respiratory decomensation extubated over the next two days oxygenation improved vent wean was tried oxygenation deteriorated cxr became consistent with ards patient was started empirically zosyn febrile episode sputum cultures would ultimately grow out pan sensitive klebsiella the patient was switched levofloxacin tpn was then started were tube feeds through the feeding pod addittional chest tube was placed the patient right side effusion starting pod patient sedated paralyzed agitation poor oxygenation sedation paralysis was achieved through various combinations propofol fentanyl cis atrocurium drips ards continued worsen fio peep were increased patient continued signifigant pressor fluid requirments there was ongoing concerns possible sepsis pod steroids were started presumed adrenal insufficiency this seemed help the intermittent hypotension progress was made weaning inotropic support over the next several days there was growing concern reduced mental status initially this was thought over sedation the setting rebal failure however this failed improve with weaning the sedation ultimately scan was performed showing acute processes pod trachesotomy was placed the bedside pod patinet weakness become complete flaccid paralysis neuro consult suggested the possibility anoxic brain injury etiologies isolated the brain confirmed evidence anoxic brain injury emg was inconclusive while eeg showed specific cause focus then turned towards unit myopathy complications sedation several attempts weaning steroids resulted increased lability steroids were ultimately left alone weaned over slower course patient was thne fitted with pmv which she tolerated well over the next several days patient made progress with trach mask however pod she
