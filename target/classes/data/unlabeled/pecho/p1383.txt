problem septic arthritis arrival the the patient was afebrile with blood pressure physical exam was notable swollen left knee that was exquisitely tender palpation arthrocentesis revealed cloudy viscous fluid with wbc polys gram stain reveal organisms crystals were detected she received vancomycin presumed septic joint was taken the operating room arthrotomy drain placement she was started ceftriaxone potential gonococcal infection lyme serology was negative lyme antibody tissue cultures swab cultures reveal organisms gram stain showed anaerobic growth date well fungal acid fast bacilli blood cultures grown anything date the patient remained afebrile throughout hospital stay without leukocytosis was consulted recommended continuing vancomycin week course ceftriaxone was stopped the patient reports that knee pain less than when she arrived she able move left knee without significant pain working with physical therapy she was followed orthopedics who were pleased with recovery extensive discussion was given regarding repeat thoracentesis prior discharge patient good range motion the joint felt pain improved since admission was uncelar what diagnostic benefit would gained second thoracentesis patient developed thrombocytopenia prior discharge that was thought possibly vancomycin vancomycin was initially continued given was the optimal doctor last name patient possible agents such famotidine that may contributed thrombocytopenia hematology was consulted felt thrombocytopenia was likely related marrow suppression than vancomycin toxicity vanco was continued she was monitored several days showed progression thrombocytopenia vancomycin the decision was made continue vancomycin monitor paltelets outpatient would consider thoracentesis patient experiences increasing pain swelling difficulty with range motion anticipate some pain swelling post operative changes patient will follow with pcp orthopaedics vancomycin levels monitored thrombocytopenia patient with chronic mild thrombocytopenia history hit although documented work hospital system patient became progressively thrombocytopenic house immediately prior initial discharge significant drop platelets patient was held house days was without decrease platelets bleeding complications medical record was very carefully examined patient known exposure heparin this hospitalization the decrease platelets was felt typical hit reactivation hit previously exposed patient dic work also non revealing hematology was consulted who felt decrease was likely hit ultimately decided was due marrow suppression infection evidence vancomycin toxicity was felt minimal time course fit appropriately plan discharge follows please check platelet count twice weekly hemodialysis platelets drop patient should referred hospital evaluation continue vancomycin weeks long platelet count stable patient follow with hematology thrombocytopenia persists completion course vancomycin allergic reaction angioedema the arthrotomy synovectomy the patient daughter noticed face was swollen than normal she was was exposed vancomycin morphine anesthetic agents the arthrotomy clear which agents may contributed the swollen state whether swelling was allergic reaction fluid accumulation setting dialyzed she was transferred medicine monitored the pacu she appear respiratory compromise there was stridor exam she complain throat tightness tongue swelling she complain throat discomfort which was felt related recent intubation she was given diphenhydramine hrs famotidine bid she received methylprednisolone though this was continued given history likely septic joint she was monitored the icu overnight acei was held she became alert oriented was able speak drink swallow without problem she was called out the floor the medicine floor the patient exhibit episodes facial swelling oropharyngeal discomfort ace was restarted the floor prior discharge without difficulty facial swelling resolved with dialysis may due volume overload rather than angioedema furthermore question whether there may component central vein stenosis patient brachiocephalic veing svc stenosis that was dilated nonresponsiveness hemodialysis the patient became transiently hypotensive the briefly non responsive the session was stopped she was monitored the icu she episodes non responsiveness though she long history these events hemodialysis sessions she remained normotensive the medical floor throughout stay end stage renal disease hemodialysis patient episode hypotension nonresponsiveness described schedule sat she recieved erythropoietin cinacalcet was also administered calcium control cinacalcet was discontinued prior discharge due hypocalcemia tunnelled dialysis catheter removed house some residual swelling removal evaluated with ultrasound that showed small hematoma continue followed clinically was stable prior discharge breast swelling patient noted breast swollen given history untreated breast cancer arimidex concern was progression malignancy oncology recommended outpatient mammogram usd evaluation swelling improved with dilation brachiocephalic svc stenosis exam was otherwise unremarkable outpatient follow outlined type diabetes mellitus remained stable she was continued insulin nph bid humalog sliding scale some elevated finger sticks the day nph was increased units qam hypertension remained
