developing resistance third generation cephalosporins antibiotics were changed ciprofloxacin cefepime vancomycin was discontinued patient continued hemodynamically stable without pressor support was afebrile acute pain was felt stable the floor hospital day infectious disease was briefly consulted with regard the organism treatment course consultants advised that single therapy with third generation cephalosporin should avoided given the theoretical possibility inducible beta lactamase therefore was recommended that patient initiated course oral levofloxacin continue treatment outpatient patient continued hemodynamically stable afebrile was discharged home with course oral levofloxacin return clinic week following discharge anticoagulation patient history pulmonary embolism
