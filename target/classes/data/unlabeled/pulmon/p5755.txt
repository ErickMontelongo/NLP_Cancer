admission date discharge date date birth sex service location chief complaint status post right middle lobe bronchus stent removal with hemoptysis airway secretion history present illness this year old female with past medical history significant stage iii nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed fall with recurrent factor viii deficiency epilepsy who presents with hemoptysis excessive secretions status post right main bronchus stent removal originally patient was diagnosed with nonsmall cell lung cancer fall was treated with xrt chemotherapy with carboplatin taxol disease reoccurred she was treated with xrt with minimal response the lung cancer then progressed the patient underwent bronchoscopy via cytology revealed nonsmall cell lung cancer with stent placement the bronchus intermedius poststent demonstrated adequate placement however the patient was unable tolerate the stent with persistent cough increased secretions she presents today elective stent removal the procedure was complicated hemoptysis poststent removal which was controlled with suctioning airway protection arrival the patient complains shortness breath with increased nonbloody secretions which improved with nebulized lidocaine she also complains mild anterior right chest discomfort which chronic pleuritic she denies nausea vomiting headache chills past medical history stage iii nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed fall treated with carboplatin taxol induction with low dose xrt she also second xrt treatment suffered some radiation pneumonitis catanenial epilepsy treated factor viii deficiency

creatinine glucose calcium magnesium phosphate bronchial brushing showed positive sample nonsmall cell lung cancer cells pleural fluid show reactive mesothelial cells malignant cells chest scan status post stent showed stent the right upper lobe bronchus marked with narrowing origin the right middle bronchus moderate pericardial effusion small partial loculated right pleural effusion right middle lobe opacity diffuse emphysema chest ray showed moderate large right pleural effusion new consistent with compared with chest ray hospital course pulmonary hemoptysis patient was initially admitted the intensive care unit keep saturation secretions cough were managed with fentanyl saline nebulizer treatments she episode hemoptysis while the intensive care unit actually came oxygen requirement nonrebreather sating liters hematocrit remained stable she was called out the floor where she was quite stable until the second day the medical floor where she then experienced three tablespoons hemoptysis she was then transferred back the medical intensive care unit observation hematocrit remained stable hemoptysis decreased frequency seven episodes day just five episodes day with sputum production consistent with rust colored phlegm she frank hemoptysis while the medical intensive care unit she was then called out the medical floor where she soon greater than hemoptysis cardiopulmonary resuscitation was aggressively attempted that the patient revived airway managed with the blood that was aspirated episode hemoptysis the code was finally called with pronunciation death secondary aspiration hemoptysis regards pulmonary effusion was thought that there was need thoracentesis this time the patient was spike fever the pulmonary team would consider thoracentesis however she never spike fever infectious disease the patient blood cultures sputum that grew out mssa she was initially treated with vancomycin gram bid continued vancomycin given that she might develop sensitivities types antibiotics the fact that she was tolerating vancomycin quite well given that vancomycin trough was less than dosage was increased bid the vancomycin transesophageal echocardiogram was never done the patient requested that she some time recover hemoptysis nonsmall cell lung cancer the patient was initially going setup phototherapy however this attempted was felt that lung cancer eroded pulmonary arteries leading the hemoptysis which eventually led death discharge diagnoses death secondary aspiration hemoptysis nonsmall lung cancer eroding pulmonary arteries
