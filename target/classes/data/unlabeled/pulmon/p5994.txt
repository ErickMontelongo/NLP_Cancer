were obtained through the chest with contrast reconstructions the lung algorithm comparison portable chest chest with contrast there large mass within the left lung abutting the left heart border invading the mediastinal airway vascular structures this mass causes complete collapse the left upper lobe bronchus partial collapse left lower lobe bronchus measurable solid components measures this mass compresses the left main pulmonary artery diameter additionally the left main stem bronchus narrowed the hilum this invasive mass adjacent lymphadenopathy large conglomerate lymph number the subcarinal right hilar region also causes narrowing the right bronchus intermedius compression the right upper lobe bronchus this right hilar lymphadenopathy measures additionally there very large right supraclavicular lymph node measuring the patient intubated just the level the carina lymphadenopathy compresses the trachea within the remainder the lung fields multiple metastatic nodules masses identified the largest within the right middle lobe measuring there significant pleural effusions the heart normal size described there significant narrowing the left main pulmonary artery there probable narrowing the left main pulmonary artery that compressed subcarinal right hilar lymphadenopathy there atherosclerotic calcifications seen within the aorta coronary arteries there small pericardial effusion within the imaged portion the abdomen the gallbladder noted distended additionally just the gallbladder subtle rounded density which may represent metastatic lesion measuring

last transferred hospital hospital doctor last name interventional pulmonology service the hospital evaluation central airway obstruction possible stent placement she elevated wbc chest ray demonstrated complete whiteout the left chest she was afebrile was empirically started vancomycin meropenem she was placed bipap maintain oxygenation she underwent elective intubation bronchoscopy which demonstrated extrinsic compression the left right mainstem bronchi details the operation please refer the operative report she was continued the antibiotics remained afebrile the patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy flexible bronchoscopy balloon dilatation ultraflex covered metallic stent placement the lll details the operation please refer the operative report she was continued the antibiotics remained afebrile intubated status post stent placement the patient was found fib metoprolol amiodarone were started she was continued the antibiotics remained afebrile she ahd converted back normal sinus rhythm she was extubated early the morning however mid evening was found that she was progressive respiratory failure intubation was done she underwent flexible bronchoscopy with tumor excision details the operation please refer the operative report she underwent flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration retained secretions details the operation please refer the operative report trials pressure support extubation failed with increasing respiratory rates poor arterial blood gases she underwent flexible bronchoscopy with tumor excision details the operation please refer the operative report she was continued the antibiotics remained afebrile wbc count progressively decreased continued trials extubation failed she underwent flexible bronchoscopy with aspiration retained secretions details the operation please refer the operative report she was continued the antibiotics remained afebrile continued attempts wean fromthe ventilator failed was decided
