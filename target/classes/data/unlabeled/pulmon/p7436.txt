multiple attempts control the bleeding via selective embolization were undertaken tenuous hemostasis was acheived the patient who intubated airway protection was extubated without incident suffered respiratory failure arrived with fever neutropenia the osh vanco caspo cefepime broad coverage was initiated multiple cultures were drawn given the persistent fever were negative the final read although the patient was stabilized via multiple bronchoscopies interventional radiologic procedures rebleeding remains significant risk little done another catastrophic bleed were develop persisent neutropenia was unexpected far out last dose chemotherapy however with persistent neupogen dosing the patient anc total leukocyte counts gradually increased non neutropenic state was continued vanc cefepime caspo until anc then were discontinued since the patient remained afebrile hours persistently negative culture data the time discharge the patient was with stable hematocrit adequate pain
