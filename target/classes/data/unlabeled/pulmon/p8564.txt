female first name brief hospital course hospital course problem respiratory failure mrs known patient lastname was admitted with hypercarbia mental status changes baseline she severe copd with fev was nocturnal bipap with settings prior admission without resolution symptoms with abg admission the micu she was placed bipap started methylprednisolone taper continued albuterol ipratropium that evening abg was approximately that night she suffered respiratory arrest was emergently intubated placed mechanical ventilation with fentanyl versed sedation ventilatory requirements were weaned that morning she was extubated however she quickly went respiratory distress was intubated midday she self extubated with increased work breathing respiratory distress she was intubated subsequently she was maintained mechanical ventilation with continuous sedation via fentanyl versed she was evaluated daily possibility extubation the combination anxiety agitation lowering sedation low tidal volumes with low pressure support led the conclusion that she was candidate extubation she went the tracheostomy left lingular bal egd open tube were performed notably she concretized tube feeds esophagus follow formal egd biopsy were recommended the procedure was otherwise uncomplicated post course was marked tachycardia hypertension with sputum cultures continuing grow mrsa day course vancomycin was completed the patient was placed day course linezolid the patient successfully underwent multiple trach mask trials the patient pulled out tracheostomy tube briefly intubated the tracheostomy tube was placed that morning trach mask trials were initiated blood pressure the intubation the night arrival she became hypotensive with sbps the was given ivf boluses started phenylephrine norepinephrine drips cortisol stimulation test was normal this episode hypotension was ascribed hypovolemia preload dependence sedation following placement central line she was given fluid boluses maintain cvp she was placed pressors neosynephrin drip intubation this pressor requirement quickly resolved she then maintained blood pressure systolic with hypertensive episodes when anxious agitated mrsa bacteremia

blood cultures sputum cultures wbc jumped with clear left shift then trended baseline high low over the next several days zosyn was five day course gentamicin was added synergy with vancomycin tte was negative vegetations lesions secretions were longer thick were minimal wbc was baseline last positive blood culture was surveillance cultures remained growth pneumonia treated prior admission with levaquin two courses management copd flairs cxr admission showed bilateral lower lobe interstitial infiltrate concerning pneuomonia she was given five day course azithromycin empiric treatment cap rapid viral cultures were negative initial sputum sample was positive gram positive cocci pairs second sample was negative cultures grew sparse oropharyngeal flora sputum cultures grew mrsa she was treated with vancomycin which she was mrsa bacteremia then linezolid day course initiated mental status while intubated patient was kept versed fentanyl drips however she periods agitation concerning thrashing movement episodes self extubation attempting pharmacological intervention with ativan haldol ambien zyprexa regimens were simplified she was weaned entirely fentanyl versed maintained prn ativan zyprexa she continued waxing doctor last name mental status requiring restraints night when bed post intubation nutrition was provided tube feeds probalance she open tube placement the time tracheostomy the tube was subsequently used feeding abd done complaint abdominal tenderness well persistent low grade fevers revealed phlegmon extending the subcutaneous tissues the peritoneum with
