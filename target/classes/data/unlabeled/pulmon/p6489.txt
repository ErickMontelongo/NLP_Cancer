the phone was then supposed picking left the house she thinks must the accident the location accident was strange she reports this would route pick was brought the scene hospital hospital where was found left facial left sided weakness arm leg was awake head was read unremarkable the abdomen showed splenic laceration was then sent these scans were received contrast the head the abdominal scan was repeated which showed question basilar artery hyperdensity over the pons this was post contrast review prior osh contrast this area somewhat motion degraded appear slightly bright this point the option iatpa was raised there were several problems first accurate time onset second splenic laceration was recently traumatic mva this was the concerning possible contraindication lysis the admitting trauma team called their attending who told them want pursue thrombolysis matter what the concern basilar thrombosis given the high possibility that would bleed spleen which fatal next the received contrast load several hours earlier addition was discovered that shellfish allergy although fine with first contrast load given the fact that the trauma attending want pursue thrombolysis the patient was put mra assess vessels the need hyperacute scanning along with the risks cta this were diminished given the fact that thrombolysis would pursued per admitting team this was then discussed with the stroke fellow who felt that acute scan should performed given the high morbidity basilar artery thrombosis the surgical team felt differently strongly that cta should performed given the risks lack thrombolysis performed discussion was held the end the was slotted get urgent partial mri dwi mra answer the question whether the basilar was truly occluded this would add minutes the process the
