emergency room following brief syncopal episode that was preceded acute shortness breath the patient states that pulmonary symptoms prior when developed acute shortness breath which was seen hospital was found large right sided pleural effusion that time pleurocentesis yielded malignant fluid that was later diagnosed adenocarcinoma follow scan the chest abdomen revealed metastases the liver the patient that time was started taxol carboplatin received second round chemotherapy three days prior this admission the morning admission the patient states that was usual state health went dinner with parents shortly started complain increasing shortness breath that was relieved home oxygen the mother reports that the patient started hyperventilate then briefly passed out there was head trauma seizure activity bowel bladder incontinence the patient denies chest pain chest tightness also denies recent weight gain increased swelling the lower extremities report two pillow orthopnea neither the mother the patient were really able adequately describe the dyspnea they were able say whether was air hunger unable catch breath whether was just unable catch deep breath their description was that the patient just increased breathing efforts past medical history familial dysautonomia this rare genetic disorder progressive sensorimotor neuropathy where the patient tends lose reflexes hypotonia decreased perception pain temperature orthostatic hypotension swallowing dysfunction right hip fracture status post open reduction internal fixation adenocarcinoma unknown origin presumed lung cancer with metastases the liver allergies include aspirin medications upon admission follows valium prn florinef doctor first name actonel weekly artificial eyedrops compazine prn multivitamin carboplatin taxol social history the patient denies alcohol drug use smoking history lives group home labs upon admission follows white blood count hematocrit platelet count differential showed neutrophils bands lymphocytes monocytes eosinophils basophils chem showed sodium potassium chloride bicarb bun creatinine glucose inr urinalysis revealed trace proteins greater than glucose cardiac enzymes were cycled were negative ekg showed sinus tachycardia beats per minute normal axis left ventricular hypertrophy left atrial abnormality wave inversion leads iii waves normal intervals chest ray revealed severe kyphoscoliosis ill defined opacity the right lung base the chest revealed evidence pulmonary emboli large consolidation the right lung base with air bronchograms suggestive pneumonia given the dilated gas filled esophagus aspiration pneumonia should considered there was also smaller possible left lower lobe pneumonia marked rotary scoliosis the thoracic spine multiple sclerotic foci the lower thoracic vertebral bodies that represent metastases echocardiogram was also performed the echocardiogram results showed normal left atrium left ventricular wall thickness left cavity size were normal overall left ventricular systolic function was greater than right ventricular chamber size was normal there was mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis the aortic root was moderately dilated the aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened aortic regurgitation was seen the mitral valve appeared structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was normal there was trivial pericardial effusion physical exam included the following heart rate was blood pressure ranged systolic diastolic respiratory rate sats room air nonrebreather temperature upon admission general this was frail appearing male who appeared older than stated age was minor respiratory distress nonrebreather mask there was audible gurgling was alert oriented decreased reflexes the upper lower extremities the patient notable jvd the angle the mandible was anicteric pinpoint pupils bilaterally chest showed severe kyphoscoliosis there were rales rhonchi throughout the entire right lung the patient also egophony the right side rales rhonchi the lower half the left chest the patient palpable pmi was regular rate rhythm with loud abdomen showed two well healed midabdominal scars was without rebound tenderness tenderness deep palpation hepatosplenomegaly appreciated normal bowel sounds the patient edema the left leg pedal edema the right leg hospital course this was year old male with history familial dysautonomia lung cancer who presented with acute onset dyspnea the dyspnea appeared due number factors include decreased compliance due kyphoscoliosis large pleural effusion possible aspiration pneumonia anemia questionable myocardial dysfunction the emergency room the patient was given lasix responded with approximately liters urine over the next three four hours due autonomic dysfunction the patient was repleted with several boluses total liters net loss was approximately liters the first hours following the diuresis the patient saturation improved was able weaned the nonrebreather the nasal cannula the patient was also started levaquin possible pneumonia the patient white blood count upon admission was with bands initially was thought that this was due chemotherapy neupogen the second day admission the patient white blood count dropped discussion with the patient oncologist this precipitous drop was consistent with the nadir expected with chemotherapy regimen the patient was observed continued improve was requested that stay one additional night the general medicine floor observation the patient insisted going home stated that would follow with primary care physician oncologist the next week was discharged home stable condition discharge diagnoses familial dysautonomia
