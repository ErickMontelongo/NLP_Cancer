significant recent diagnosis nsclc chemo xrt admitted persistent fever sob cough days found leulocytosis elevated dimer new lll findings cxr the following issues were addressed extended hospitalization pulmonary she cta initially due dye allergy echo was done which showed evidence right heart strain she continued hypoxic though was suspected she was put heparin empirically dimer was drawn very high this the result someone with cancer well though she was premedicated cta revealed multiple right sided pes she was continued the heparin this finding she was also continued oxygen was maintaining good sats she remained tachypneic tachycardic though due recent study the nejm which showed benefit lmwh over coumadin cancer patients preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism she was started lovenox instead coumadin she continued tachypneic tachycardic the remainder the admission she also continued require oxygen keep sats she was switched back heparin drip several days order invasive procedures undertaken without problem this she was put back lovenox issues with pes she was sent out lovenox bid prevent recurrence dvt fevers pneumonia she initially presented lul density cxr while xrt this was treated outpatient days with levaquin with improvement she fevers chills night sweats days admission when she was admitted she was started unasyn the ficu she defervesed initially this remained several days she continued persistent cough though requirement decrease cxrs continued show lul infiltrate she began daily fevers she was changed zosyn continued daily fevers this source infection was identified she negative blood cultures negative urine cultures obvious source cellulitis skin involvement she continue persistent productive cough with nothing growing sputum pulmonary was consulted performed bronchoscopy they found that she complete airway obstruction some partial compression airways tumor this added the suspicion that she may post obstructive pneumonia bal was performed grew bacteria grow female first name albicans she some known oral last name first name there was question whether this was contaminant was consulted she was started fluconazole azithromycin the zosyn was also continued she continued spike daily fevers through antibiotics though repeat cxrs showed growing pleural effusion the left was called ultrasound guided thoracentesis they were able get very little fluid despite seeing large amount ultrasound appeared possibly loculated appeared transudate grow anything culture she complication pneumothorax that side she pain kept good sats with this was treated with nrb oxygen followed serial cxrs resolved own the next day the oxygen mask was stopped recur she continued spike fevers despite the antibiotics good source was found she also continued coughing multiple blood cultures urine cultures continued sent with growth another though physical was performed with evidence skin infection abscess oral infection otitis sinusitis perirectal abscess she was dysuria abdominal pain lactate was sent normal this point the main hypothesis was post obstructive pneumonia tumor fever was also possible cause these fevers the face countless negative cultures was drug fever she the fevers outpatient though none drugs were suspicious causing fevers also the candidal lung infection was considered symptoms showed improvement despite high dose fluconazole was consulted stenting bronchus help alleviate possible post obstructive pneumonia due anatomy she was candidate this intervention she finished full course fluconazole with really change this medication was stopped she was also switched cipro augmentin which continued cover possible gram positive negative pathogens that were covering with with antibiotics she change clinical picture with this switch the hypothesis post obstrucive pneumonia was the likely she was candidate pulmonary stent the plan became continue radiation therapy also restart low dose chemo with the hope shrinking the tumor relieving the obstruction this was tried occured several chemo administrations oxygen requirement improving slowly though she gradually worked needing maintain good oxygenation with this she was eventually sent home with the ciprofloxacin augmentin she continued daily fevers positive cultures fevers were controlled with tylenol throughout the hospitalization this worked well she was also atrovent nebs fairly regularly which helped keep breathing easier oxygen requirements she was sent home with mdis use albuterol wasn used often due already persistent tachycardia tachycardia she persistent tachycardia the entire admission was attributed the pes fever anxiety some combination these three she echo which showed wall motion abnormalities cardiac enzymes checked troponins were mildly elevated this was felt leak the strain she was under the pes opposed actual ecgs showed old new ischemic changes tsh was normal she never chest pain tachycardia continued the entire hospitalization mildly fevers continued well difficult separate the two the tachycardia was monitored treated this setting she was also anemic this may contributed anemia inpatient hct started gradually drifting downward she negative stool guaiacs throughout hematuria melena hematemesis hemoptysis iron studies were sent showed combination anemia chronic disease possible iron deficiency anemias she normal folate hemolysis labs were sent indicate hemolysis she was transfused two separate occasions keep hct she was anticoagulated bleeding was considered thoroughly she never source bleeding identified the chemo may partially responsible dropping hct lung cancer she continued receive xrt hospitalization she also received several cycles doctor last name taxol while inpatient low doses due acute illness she tolerated this very well she initial mri outpatient center that suggested the presence brain met the mri was repeated superior equipment there was evidence metastases the brain near the end stay planning done rad onc suggested progression disease rather than regression chemo was changed was radiation portal she will continue with this new protocol outpatient follow will also done outpatient she wasn able get one inpatient she will continue with daily outpatient xrt weekly chemo with last name stitle diabetes she was kept home glipizide dose riss cover high blood glucoses she fairly good control throughout with occassional high numbers days she received steroids chemo premedication otherwise this was stable anxiety she was fairly anxious much the hospitalization there was lot going around many definite answers she was given ativan prn this worked well she also used codeine cough syrup nights which helped cough insomnia external yeast infection she developed candidal infection groin folds this was treated with miconazole powder effectively begun return upon discharge she was sent home with this treatment use she also oral candidiasis one point this was treated with nystatin along with the fluconazole resolved with these therapies she was encouraged get out bed frequently prevent atelectasis deconditioning she worked with often regained some energy strength she was eventually able climb stairs walk the halls well she also spent days chair instead bed she require oxygen while ambulating rest though she was discharged home with services home vna home plans come daily xrt weekly chemo she was continued cipro augmentin well lovenox she continued daily fevers they were well controlled with tylenol she
