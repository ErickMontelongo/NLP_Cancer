two days admission showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function right ventricular free wall hypokinesis possible ischemia given normal systolic pressure mild aortic regurgitation cxr admission showed possible ards pneumonia pulmonary edema fluid overload lungs secondary systolic dysfuction may also pna especially since wbc was elevated fevers however there was also pulmonary fibrosis breast lung cancer she received captopril diurese help chf she was also given ipratropium inhalers one day admission the family indicated the social worker that the patient home hospice care two weeks prior the patient refused hospice fill narctoics pain palliative care consult was obtained patient was still intubated respiratory status was improving great degree patient patient family made the decision extubate the patient knowing that she would likely die when extubated this was per the family consistent with the patient previous expressed wishes note patient hct dropped admission family was informed the necessity transfusion refused blood transfusions the patient was made comfort measures extubated with family present consistent with the wishes the patient was extubated she was pronounced dead with the family side family declined autospys performed acute blood loss anemia hct dropped significantly the past day this can explained two hematomas oozing the cath possible that she bleeding somewhere else will check hct see stable check stool guiacs medications admission meds unknown may include diovan discharge medications patient
