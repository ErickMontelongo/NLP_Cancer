found mrs last name stitle great risk aspiration liquids she was kept soft solid diet with liquids while the hospital however the paralysis worsened came involve vocal cords mrs last name stitle was kept npo peg was placed that was advanced tube poor motility possible proximal obstruction radation therapy was initiated the hopes shrinking the mediastinal masses relieving the paralysis metstatic

causative bilateral vocal cord paralysis ent followed mrs last name stitle through the course hospitalization evaluate function initially she was undergo medialization however the evening prior the procedure she was scoped found bilateral involvement airway closure would even greater risk with the new development the plans medialization were suspended xrt was initiated the hopes that the mediastinal lad would decompressed with resultant improvement paralysis ent continued follow mrs last name stitle with daily scoping appeared that were reapproximating making airway closure almost inevitable rather than waiting this occur was decided that mrs last name stitle should undergo tracheostomy ensure patent airway she tolerated the procedure well was followed ent respiratory care post

stitle copd flared the course hospitalization she recveived nebulizers chest mucomyst supplemental prn steroid taper sats this regimen remained stable the range however over the course stay she became dependent exacerbating mrs last name stitle pulmonary status was pleural effusion that developed over the week she thoracentesis remove fluid the effusion was likely the result the lung there was evidence pna empyema she began improve respiratory standpoint ventilatory weaning sprint rest method was initiated first she was able tolerate hours the tracheostomy mask becoming acidotic eventually however she tolerated hours time without ventilatory support she appeared these periods the vent comfortable however the patient began fatigue continued trials eventually was requiring the ventilator increasing periods time the tracheostomy site was inspected appeared oozing purulent serosanginous fluid times interventional pulmonology following consultation felt that the site tracheostomy was too large that was erythematous draining the trachea the patient was treated with vancomycin levofloxacin aztreonam day day course she continued spike the vanco levoflox were added they were they were she was continued day course meropeen alone hour period rest the patient was tried short period the trach mask acutely became uncomfortable diaphoretic hypercapneic number trials was felt that the

rehab coumadin with goal inr however platelets began drop she was considered hit the hit came back negative given the time course lack etiologies rebound platelet count heparin hit seems likely was switched lepirudin direct thrombin inhibitor restarted warfarin fen the swallow study noted that mrs last name stitle was great doctor first name aspiration was determined that she would need peg tube feeding she received peg received promote with fiber advanced rate electrolytes were monitored repleted necessary meds were given either through the peg she was strictly npo the peg was advanced tube

gram cocci blood culture was put vanco levofloxacin the culture came back coag negative staph the vancomycin was stopped since recovered without episodes hypotension will require levofloxacin until which time she should additional blood cultures drawn positive becomes febrile she may require tee evaluation endocarditis given mitral replacement atrial fibrillation rate was well controlled
