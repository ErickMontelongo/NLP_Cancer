entire procedure technique findings the patient daughter were explained details the potential risks benefits the procedure informed consent was obtained the daughter the patient was placed supine the angiographic table right groin was sterilely prepped draped local anesthesia was given with lidocaine the subcutaneous tissue the right groin gauge needle was used access the right common femoral artery bentson guidewire was advanced through the needle the distal aorta under fluoroscopic guidance the needle was exchanged french sheath the side arm which was connected continuous irrigation with heparinized saline cobra glidecatheter hydrophilic glidewire were used combination access the right renal artery selective contrast arteriogram was obtained the projection with the catheter tip located front the right renal artery close the ostium the lower branch the right renal artery this showed early bifurcation this branch with the medial one describing smooth curve with medial convexity reaching the lateral side the kidney this medial branch eventually tapers over date renal angio clip clip number radiology reason please perform right renal arteriogram evaluate bleed admitting diagnosis atrial fibrillation telemetry contrast optiray amt final report cont filling biloculated pseudoaneurysmal sac the sac located lateral the existing nephrostomy tube early venous drainage observed the two sacs joins two ascending branches going the right renal vein furthermore there small vessel dilations the upper half the right kidney with early venous filling the findings consistent with arteriovenous malformation avm actual extravasation contrast seen the catheter was advanced the descending medial branch the right renal artery described superselective arteriograms were obtained the biloculated pseudoaneurysmal sac filled directly main branch the right renal artery concomitant renal parenchymography was seen superselective injections suggesting the presence steal phenomenon the renal parenchymal towards the avm thus given the patient history the angiographic appearance decision was made embolize the feeding branch these pseudoaneurysms the cobra glidecatheter was then advanced easily over the wire until reached the distal portion the descending medial branch described just tapers eventually fills the sac described the distal portion this artery was then embolized successfully with two cook coils followed two cook coils stagnant flow was then observed control arteriogram the level the distal portion this posterior medial renal artery with preservation branch filling the lower pole the right kidney opacification the pseudoaneurysmal sac was present the same arteriogram the catheter was then pulled back controlled arteriograms were obtained with catheter tip the lower branch the right renal artery well the main renal artery showing satisfactory status the embolized artery patency the lower pole artery unchanged appearance the arterial branches going the upper half the right kidney the catheter wires were then removed well the sheath hemostasis the entry site was obtained manual compression the righ groin the patient tolerated the procedure well immediate complications were observed medications the entire procedure required total intra arterial contrast the procedure was performed under conscious sedation with versed fentanyl given divided doses under continuous hemodynamic monitoring conclusion successful embolization inferomedial branch the right renal artery feeding bilobular pseudoaneurysmal sac over
