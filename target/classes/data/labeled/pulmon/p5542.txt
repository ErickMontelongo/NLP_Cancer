fever began spike multiple repeat blood cultures were drawn chest was obtained there was question post obstructive pneumonia that was discussed with radiology interventional pulmonology upon discussion this was ruled out deemed small narrowing the right middle lobe bronchus with subsegmental collapse the lobe infectious disease consult was also obtained they recommended vancomycin cefepime days then subsequent blood cultures ensure that the bacteria was cleared the blood they also recommended echocardiography the heart tte tee order make sure there were vegetations the heart
