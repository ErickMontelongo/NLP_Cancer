was noted worsening hypoxia with increasing nausea nonbloody nonbilious vomiting well headache the morning the patient became belligerent with dropping oxygen saturations room air saturation was which improved liters half hour later she was noted desaturation liters hospital level positive airway pressure was initiated improved liters hospital level positive airway pressure with settings arterial blood gas performed room air revealed pco pao hospital level positive airway pressure was increased liters that point medical intensive care unit course was significant diuresis with intravenous lasix the patient received intravenous lasix times two over day period with good response she diuresed total approximately liters while the medical intensive care unit hours the thought was the patient may developed acute pulmonary edema secondary elevated blood pressure plus minus tachycardia quick resolution however would likely consistent with mucous plug however improvement with diuresis would lean towards pulmonary edema picture with chest ray confirming that diagnosis the patient was then transferred the floor diuresis initiation hospital level positive airway pressure night obstructive doctor last name apnea issues the patient was maintained overnight hospital level positive airway pressure with settings with liters nasal cannula she tolerated this well six eight hours per night was
